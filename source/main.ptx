        <title>Introduction: What is this for?</title>
        <p>
          The goal for this textbook is that it be different.
          Though many familiar topics will be explored, the person thinking along with this book
          will, with luck and commitment, work their way towards a different view of the world
          as it now exists. Ideally, the person thinking along with this book will find themselves
          committed to radical restructuring of the existing world order, which, in the opinion of this
          book<rsq/>s author, is monstrously wasteful of human potential, ecocidal towards human and
          nonhuman life, disruptive of unique and fascinating natural processes, stiflingly unfree and 
          cramped in its practices and beliefs.        
          Mathematics and its associated fields (statistics, data science, computer science,
          and so on) are often used to describe or predict the world. This is no longer enough. 
          The point is to change the world. The hope, and the wager, is that an approach to 
          some basic and fundamental mathematical ideas can equip and energize the reader, that is, you, 
          for that beautiful, important, and ennobling task.

          The French thinker Jacques Ranciere wrote a fascinating book,
          <pubtitle>The Ignorant Schoolmaster</pubtitle> about the
          French educator Joseph Jacotot. To radically oversimplify the point:
          Jacotot believed that all humans are equally intelligent and that
          explanation and lecture could often serve the purpose of 
          <q>stultifying</q>. That is, there is real cost in striving to skip
          past the struggle to understand by way of an explanation from a
          so-called authority in the subject. A powerful and challenging thought!

        <title>Percentages and Proportionality</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            We will open with a consideration of fractions, proportions, and percentages.
            These ideas are deeply interrelated and, what is more, incredibly tied
            to a lot of intuitive ideas about fairness.
          </p>
        </introduction>
        <section xml:id="sec-proportion">
          <title>Proportion</title>
          
            <p>
              We begin with a very simple sort of idea, one that you have probably seen before. 
              It is the idea of proportion or fraction. In what we might optimistically
              interpret as a hopeful sign, this concept is often introduced using the idea 
              of fair division of resources. If there are four bottles of water and four
              thirsty people, then we might easily decide that each thirsty person should
              get one bottle of water. That is, we divide the four bottles four ways, which 
              allows one bottle in each group. We indicate this by 
              <me>
                4 \div 4 = 1  
              </me>
              or
              <me>
                \dfrac{4}{4} = 1
              </me>.
              If we have eight bottles of water and four thirsty people, then:
              <me>
                \dfrac{8}{4}=2
              </me>
              and we conclude that we can give each person two bottles of water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this rests on an assumption that each person has equal need 
              for water. This assumption is extremely time- and situation-dependent.
              If one of the people has just been rescued from the desert or one of 
              the people is a child, we may need to adjust our use of mathematics.
              This may seem very obvious, yet many of our analyses of real-life 
              situations will show how often this assumption is ignored or abused, 
              usually when it favors the rich and/or powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
              This idea is easily extended beyond whole numbers into fractions, 
              though it is possible you have not thought about this aspect of fractions
              for some time. (Much of this text will be seeking to render visible 
              the assumptions and initial intuitive notions that may have been 
              introduced to you so long ago that you have forgotten why they are 
              intuitive.) But if we have six cookies and 12 children (all of whom 
              can safely eat all the ingredients in the cookies) we can, once more,
              use division to determine how many cookies each child may have. It 
              should be evident that there aren't enough cookies even for each 
              child to have a whole one to themselves.
              <me>
                \dfrac{6}{12}=0.5
              </me>
              This tells us that each child can have 0.5 of a cookie, which we tend to 
              call half a cookie, or <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> a cookie. You probably 
              understand the concept of <q>half</q>.
              But what if two of the children suddenly announce that they do not like
              this sort of cookie and would prefer not to have any. Now we have ten children
              and six cookies, which yields the situation:
              <me>
                \dfrac{6}{10}=0.6
              </me>
              This tells us that each child gets 0.6 of a cookie. What does this mean?
              We know it is less than a cookie and more than half a cookie. But how
              do we say anything more carefully and more explicit than this?
            </p>
            <p>
              If you found yourself saying, <q>That means 60% of a cookie,</q> then 
              congratulations. You just introduced us to the topic of the next section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we move on, we can recognize here the first instance of
              an important pattern. Many mathematical learners find themselves 
              impatient with memorization and formulas. This is quite understandable,
              especially when these have been used in place of building intuition 
              about why something works, why something does what we claim that it 
              does. This reflects our commitment to <xref ref="axiom-intuitive-math"/>. 
              In this case, the pattern to notice is that the number in the numerator
              (the top of the fraction) represents the number of objects we are 
              intending to share, while the denominator is the number of people we are 
              intending to share the objects amongst.
              <men>
                \dfrac{\text{# of objects to distribute}}
                {\text{# of objects that will receive what we distribute}}
              </men>
              We will, many times, find ourselves creating a template like this forming
              a simple fraction which will, nevertheless, provide us with powerful tools
              for supplementing our human intutiion.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, we have a technical name for the description of a 
              process that allows us to compute
              or understand some situation: <term>algorithm</term>. This name is one of
              many that derive from Arabic or Islamic sources, a creative and
              vibrant piece of mathematical
              history that was ignored or de-emphasized by
              so-called <q>Western</q> historians and mathematicians
              for far too long. You can find out
              more in Berggren's <pubtitle>Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam</pubtitle>. 
              The word <q>algorithm</q> itself comes from the
              name of the Islamic mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, about whom you can read
              from the venerable St Andrews site on the history of math.

          <title>Percent</title>
            <p>
              Once we have the idea of a fraction, there is a benefit to introducing
              a sort of general format for a fraction. This is what a percent is. 
              It is even right there in the name, <em>percent</em>, from Latin. 
              The English language is filled with all sorts of fragments from other
              languages. Think of how you have heard <q>per</q> used. 60 miles per hour.
              45,000 dollars per year. 2000 calories per day. One dollar per taco.
              In each case, we are being
              informed of a certain amount of things for each of another object.
              So what does <q>cent</q> stand for then? If you think of the word 
              century, which is 100 years, maybe you will realize it stands for 100.
              So if we say <q>60 percent</q> we are really saying, <q>60 for each
              100</q>. So if we say, <q>60 percent of those children over there
              would like to eat
              some candy,</q> what we are actually expressing is that <q>if there 
              were 100 children like those children over there, then 60 of them
              would like to eat some candy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you see how this is a sort of standardized form of a fraction?
              We could say <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> or a quarter, but if we want a percent?
              We would say <q>25 percent.</q> Note also that we have a familiar
              notation for percent, which looks like this: %. So we could also just
              write: 25%. 
            </p>
            <subsection xml:id="subsec-general-fact">
              <title>A Useful General Fact about Percents and Proportions</title>
              <p>
                None of this would probably be worth learning, if not for what follows.
                Let us think about the situation with 12 children and six cookies.
                What if one of those children goes home and realizes that they would
                like to share their portion of a cookie, which we can recall was
                half a cookie, with their two other siblings. But then how much cookie
                does each sibling receive, if we assume that all three of them get
                the same amount? We are now dividing half the cookie into three equal
                pieces. If we think from the start of the process we can see:
                <me>
                  \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)}{3}=\dfrac{1}{6} \approx 0.167.
                </me>
                Note that this means we could say that each child gets approximately
                16.7% of a cookie. Or one-sixth of a cookie. Perhaps you recall that the 
                process above can also be accomplished by multiplication:
                <me>
                  \left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)\times\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)
                  =\dfrac{6}{36}=\dfrac{1}{6}\approx 0.167=16.7\%
                </me>
                We can think of this as first dividing the six cookies into 12 pieces,
                then dividing one of those smaller pieces into three equal pieces.
                This process is carried out by successive applications of taking some
                percentage.
              </p>
              <p>
                But let us emphasize this point: We may learn what percent of a cookie
                we are left with if we start with 50% of a cookie and then take 33% of it
                by multiplying the two decimal forms of these percents:
                <me>
                  (0.50)\times(0.3\overline{3})=0.16\overline{6}
                </me>
                Note that we should always be careful when moving from fractions to 
                decimal approximations of numbers or percentages. (This is a nice
                example of how moving between modes of implementation can sometimes
                mislead us.)

              Regardless of how deeply unjust and violent the current state 
              of the USA might be, and has arguably
              always been, at its founding it was based in certain principles, 
              including which was an idea about
              proportionality in decision making. In particular, an idea that 
              if states were to be represented in a legislative body, then
              those states should (sometimes) have that representation
              scaled by the population of that state. From the start, this 
              was a contested idea for many reasons, both because there 
              was no agreement on who counted as part of population and 
              related questions of how to handle the enslaved population. 
              If enslaved persons were counted as part of the population
              even though they had no practical voice in decision-making, then
              those who enslaved them would be granted extra power within
              the decision-making bodies of the young nation. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea of a representative legislative body itself offers a 
              good lens on the idea of democracy itself. If we have a state with
              100,000 people, we could make decisions by allowing each person to
              vote directly on every decision. You can see that this might be
              rather unwieldy in practice, but there would be, in a sense,
              no distortion at all. Every person is directly represented in
              the decision-making process; each person represents themself. 
              At the other extreme, we could select (by vote or by lottery) 
              one person to make the decisions for all 100,000 people. This
              allows the one person to swiftly make decisions, but we might 
              be disturbed that this person is now a dictator, at least until
              a new person is selected. So all representative bodies in between 
              are aimed at greater efficiency than everyone voting directly and
              more nuance and less total control than the one-person-in-charge
              version. But how do we do this in a fair and reasonable way?

              Suppose you have four states<mdash/>Mardi, Omoo, Pierre, 
              Redburn<mdash/>who wish to form a representative 
              legislative body with the number of representatives proportional
              to the states' populations. The populations are 30,000 in Mardi,
              40,000 in Omoo, 
              50,000 in Pierre, 
              and 70,000 in Redburn. The legislative body is to have 101
              representatives. (Perhaps the odd number was chosen 
              to avoid ties.) How would
              you suggest that this country go about doing this?

            <p>
              A reasonable way to start is to consider proportions. Keep in mind
              the ways we have attempted to think about fairness previously. 
              What would it mean to match proportions in this case? We 
              need to recognize what proportion of population each state has.
              For that we also need total population and then we can use the 
              pattern or template we noted above.

              <em>First idea: representatives are cookies to distribute to 
                population.</em>
              Let us put it another way: we want to distribute 101 cookies to 190,000
              people. In this view, we are trying to understand how much of a
              representative does each person get representing them in the
              legislative body? 
              <question>
                <p>
                  If we find this number, what would be the
                  next logical step for finding how many representatives each
                  state should have in the legislature?

              <answer>
                <p>
                  If we have determined how much of a <q>cookie</q> each person
                  gets, then we can just see how many people are in a state and
                  add up all the (parts of) cookies that should be in that state.
                  That is, if we have determined how much of a <q>representative</q> 
                  each person is represented by,
                  then we can just see how many people are in a state and

      <chapter xml:id="ch-weighted-voting">
        <title>Power in Weighted Voting Systems</title>
        <p>
          All of the effort put into the systems described in the previous chapter were premised upon an
          intuitive idea: that if a state has, for example, twice the representatives, then it will have
          twice the power in the House of Representatives. But remember: one of the overarching themes of
          this book is that we want to be able to use mathematics and its related fields to investigate 
          whether our intuitive ideas about how things work are, in fact, accurate. We have already seen
          some examples of how this can happen. But the belief related to this idea of power is quite
          surprising and can be motivated with a relatively simple example.
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Intuition Misleading Us?</title>
          <p>
            Suppose there were three states in the nation with populations such that, in the 100-member House
            of Representatives, one state had 49 representatives, one state had 47 representatives, and a third
            state had four representatives. 
            Let us further assume that these numbers of representatives are
            proportional to population. 
            (For example, this would be exactly true if the populations were 49,000, 
            47,000, and 4000, respectively.) 
            So according to the intuition we have
            been basing our work on up until now, this system has been constructed 
            in a way that is fair. It has explicitly and exactly matched the proportion of 
            numbers of representatives to the proportion of the number of people in the
            population for each state. (If you look back at examples and exercises from 
            <xref ref="ch-democracy-representation"/> you will notice that in practice
            it will almost never happen that these proportions match so exactly. We have, 
            in a sense, imagined what seems to be a rather ideal situation for fairness
            in the proportional representation of these states in this legislative body.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we proceed further, if you were to guess how powerful each state was
            in the legislature, what would you say? Is the state with 49,000 people twice
            as powerful as the state with 4000 people? Five times as powerful? (Note: you
            should not feel bad if you have only a vague sense of this. <q>Power</q> is
            a concept that we have not carefully defined. Indeed, that is the point of this
            section, to develop a coherent approach to thinking mathematically about 
            how power might be quantified in such situations.)
          </p>
          <p>
            So let us suppose that these states have quite distinct populations and, further,
            let us suppose that each state delegation is disciplined and loyal and always
            votes together as a group. 
          </p>

        </example>
        <example>
          <p>
            Suppose a decade passes, and during that time
            1500 people move from State 2 to State 1 and 
            500 from State 3 to State 1. Now what?
          </p>

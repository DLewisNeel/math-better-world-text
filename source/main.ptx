        <title>Introduction: What is this for?</title>
        <p>
          The goal for this textbook is that it be different.
          Though many familiar topics will be explored, the person thinking along with this book
          will, with luck and commitment, work their way towards a different view of the world
          as it now exists. Ideally, the person thinking along with this book will find themselves
          committed to radical restructuring of the existing world order, which, in the opinion of this
          book<rsq/>s author, is monstrously wasteful of human potential, ecocidal towards human and
          nonhuman life, disruptive of unique and fascinating natural processes, stiflingly unfree and 
          cramped in its practices and beliefs.        
          Mathematics and its associated fields (statistics, data science, computer science,
          and so on) are often used to describe or predict the world. This is no longer enough. 
          The point is to change the world. The hope, and the wager, is that an approach to 
          some basic and fundamental mathematical ideas can equip and energize the reader, that is, you, 
          for that beautiful, important, and ennobling task.

              Quantitative reasoning, often called mathematics, is a 
              millennia-spanning human project across radically different
              cultures aimed at describing, predicting, and changing the
              world.

          The French thinker Jacques Ranciere wrote a fascinating book,
          <pubtitle>The Ignorant Schoolmaster</pubtitle> about the
          French educator Joseph Jacotot. To radically oversimplify the point:
          Jacotot believed that all humans are equally intelligent and that
          explanation and lecture could often serve the purpose of 
          <q>stultifying</q>. That is, there is real cost in striving to skip
          past the struggle to understand by way of an explanation from a
          so-called authority in the subject. A powerful and challenging thought!
          Though this author will not now cease writing, and thus will be in 
          some violation of Jacotot<rsq/>s ideas (or at least Ranciere<rsq/>s
          rendering of Jacotot<rsq/>s ideas). Still:

          A few general mathematical ideas might help us down the line. 
          <definition xml:id="def-function">
            <statement>
              <p>
                A <term>function</term> is a mathematical rule which
                receives an input (often a number or list of numbers)
                and returns an output
                (often a number) in a consistent way. That is, for each 
                particular legitimate input the function will produce the
                same output. 
              </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          The notation for functions is often what can cause a bit of
          confusion for the new mathematical thinker. It is often, when
          possible, written as a formula, but with notation that mixes
          some meaning with the way mathematical notation usually works.
          Specifically, one often sees a function <m>f</m> defined like so:
          <me>
            f(x)=5x+3
          </me>
          Please try to suppress any negative emotions associated with such 
          an expression. The problem is (and we who have become used to the
          notation sometimes forget this) that by the time someone sees this
          notation, they have generally been told that when one sees a 
          character next to an open parenthesis, <q>(</q>, that this should
          be understood as implying multiplication. Yet this is absolutely
          not what is going on in this mathematical expression. Instead, we
          are to understand (somehow) that <m>f</m> is a function, and the 
          input for that function is to be understood as <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, this expression:
          <me>
            f(x)=5x+3
          </me>
          is attempting to communicate the following information
          about this function. 
          <q>
            This function, when passed some
            numerical value, will first multiply that value
            by five, and then will take that result and add
            three to it. This number will be passed back
            to whoever input that original numerical value.
          </q>
          Another way to say this is that <m>x</m> is really just
          a way to allow us to <q>fill in the blanks</q>. We might also
          write this function like so:
          <me>
            f(\underline{~~~})=5(\underline{~~~})+3
          </me>
          This sort of filling-in-the-blanks becomes cumbersome for 
          more complex rules, though, so we use <m>x</m> instead. Another
          way we could, even more clumsily, write it would be:
          <me>
            f(\text{whatever number is here})=5(\text{that number also goes here})+3
          </me>
          Before we move on, perhaps it would be good to be specific:
          <me>
            f(2)=5(2)+3=10+3=13
          </me>
          <me>
            f(3)=5(3)+3=15+3=18
          </me>
          <me>
            f(-3)=5(-3)+3=-15+3=-12
          </me>
          <me>
            f(100)=5(100)+3=500+3=503
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Mainly, when working with a function, try to remember that
          it is just a way of telling you how to fill in the blanks.

      <chapter xml:id="ch-percent-proportion">
        <title>Percentages and Proportionality</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            We will open with a consideration of fractions, 
            proportions, and percentages.
            These ideas are deeply interrelated and, what 
            is more, incredibly tied
            to a lot of intuitive ideas about fairness.
          </p>
        </introduction>
        <section xml:id="sec-proportion">
          <title>Proportion</title>
            <p>
              We begin with a very simple sort of idea, 
              one that you have probably seen before. 
              It is the idea of proportion or fraction. 
              In what we might optimistically
              interpret as a hopeful sign, this concept is 
              often introduced using the idea 
              of fair division of resources. If there are 
              four bottles of water and four
              thirsty people, then we might easily decide 
              that each thirsty person should
              get one bottle of water. That is, we divide 
              the four bottles four ways, which 
              allows one bottle in each group. We indicate this by 
              <me>
                4 \div 4 = 1  
              </me>
              or
              <me>
                \dfrac{4}{4} = 1
              </me>.
              If we have eight bottles of water and four thirsty people, then:
              <me>
                \dfrac{8}{4}=2
              </me>
              and we conclude that we can give each person two bottles of water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this rests on an assumption that each person has equal need 
              for water. This assumption is extremely time- and situation-dependent.
              If one of the people has just been rescued from the desert or one of 
              the people is a child, we may need to adjust our use of mathematics.
              This may seem very obvious, yet many of our analyses of real-life 
              situations will show how often this assumption is ignored or abused, 
              usually when it favors the rich and/or powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
              This idea is easily extended beyond whole numbers into fractions, 
              though it is possible you have not thought about this aspect of fractions
              for some time. (Much of this text will be seeking to render visible 
              the assumptions and initial intuitive notions that may have been 
              introduced to you so long ago that you have forgotten why they are 
              intuitive.) But if we have six cookies and 12 children (all of whom 
              can safely eat all the ingredients in the cookies) we can, once more,
              use division to determine how many cookies each child may have. It 
              should be evident that there aren't enough cookies even for each 
              child to have a whole one to themselves.
              <me>
                \dfrac{6}{12}=0.5
              </me>
              This tells us that each child can have 0.5 of a cookie, which we tend to 
              call half a cookie, or <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> a cookie. You probably 
              understand the concept of <q>half</q>.
              But what if two of the children suddenly announce that they do not like
              this sort of cookie and would prefer not to have any. Now we have ten children
              and six cookies, which yields the situation:
              <me>
                \dfrac{6}{10}=0.6
              </me>
              This tells us that each child gets 0.6 of a cookie. What does this mean?
              We know it is less than a cookie and more than half a cookie. But how
              do we say anything more carefully and more explicit than this?
            </p>
            <p>
              If you found yourself saying, <q>That means 60% of a cookie,</q> then 
              congratulations. You just introduced us to the topic of the next section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we move on, we can recognize here the first instance of
              an important pattern. Many mathematical learners find themselves 
              impatient with memorization and formulas. This is quite understandable,
              especially when these have been used in place of building intuition 
              about why something works, why something does what we claim that it 
              does. This reflects our commitment to <xref ref="axiom-intuitive-math"/>. 
              In this case, the pattern to notice is that the number in the numerator
              (the top of the fraction) represents the number of objects we are 
              intending to share, while the denominator is the number of people we are 
              intending to share the objects amongst.
              <men>
                \dfrac{\text{# of objects to distribute}}
                {\text{# of objects that will receive what we distribute}}
              </men>
              We will, many times, find ourselves creating a template like this forming
              a simple fraction which will, nevertheless, provide us with powerful tools
              for supplementing our human intuition.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, we have a technical name for the description of a 
              process that allows us to compute
              or understand some situation: <term>algorithm</term>. This name is one of
              many that derive from Arabic or Islamic sources, a creative and
              vibrant piece of mathematical
              history that was ignored or de-emphasized by
              so-called <q>Western</q> historians and mathematicians
              for far too long. You can find out
              more in Berggren's 
              <pubtitle>Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam</pubtitle>. 
              The word <q>algorithm</q> itself comes from a 
              somewhat clumsy importation of the
              name of the Islamic mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, about whom you can read
              <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Khwarizmi/">here</url>,
              from the venerable St Andrews site on the history of math.

          <title>Percent</title>
          <introduction>
            <p>
              Once we have the idea of a fraction, there is a benefit to introducing
              a sort of general format for a fraction. This is what a percent is. 
              It is even right there in the name, <em>percent</em>, from Latin. 
              The English language is filled with all sorts of fragments from other
              languages. Think of how you have heard <q>per</q> used. 60 miles per hour.
              45,000 dollars per year. 2000 calories per day. One dollar per taco.
              In each case, we are being
              informed of a certain amount of things for each of another object.
              So what does <q>cent</q> stand for then? If you think of the word 
              century, which is 100 years, maybe you will realize it stands for 100.
              So if we say <q>60 percent</q> we are really saying, <q>60 for each
              100</q>. So if we say, <q>60 percent of those children over there
              would like to eat
              some candy,</q> what we are actually expressing is that <q>if there 
              were 100 children like those children over there, then 60 of them
              would like to eat some candy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you see how this is a sort of standardized form of a fraction?
              We could say <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> or a quarter, but if we want a percent?
              We would say <q>25 percent.</q> Note also that we have a familiar
              notation for percent, which looks like this: %. So we could also just
              write: 25%.

            <title>A Useful General Fact about Percents and Proportions</title>
            <p>
              None of this would probably be worth learning, if not for what follows.
              Let us think about the situation with 12 children and six cookies.
              What if one of those children goes home and realizes that they would
              like to share their portion of a cookie, which we can recall was
              half a cookie, with their two other siblings. But then how much cookie
              does each sibling receive, if we assume that all three of them get
              the same amount? We are now dividing half the cookie into three equal
              pieces. If we think from the start of the process we can see:
              <me>
                \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)}{3}=\dfrac{1}{6} \approx 0.167.
              </me>
              Note that this means we could say that each child gets approximately
              16.7% of a cookie. Or one-sixth of a cookie. Perhaps you recall that the 
              process above can also be accomplished by multiplication:
              <me>
                \left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)\times\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)
                =\dfrac{6}{36}=\dfrac{1}{6}\approx 0.167=16.7\%
              </me>
              We can think of this as first dividing the six cookies into 12 pieces,
              then dividing one of those smaller pieces into three equal pieces.
              This process is carried out by successive applications of taking some
              percentage.
            </p>
            <p>
              But let us emphasize this point: We may learn what percent of a cookie
              we are left with if we start with 50% of a cookie and then take 33% of it
              by multiplying the two decimal forms of these percents:
              <me>
                (0.50)\times(0.3\overline{3})=0.16\overline{6}
              </me>
              Note that we should always be careful when moving from fractions to 
              decimal approximations of numbers or percentages. (This is a nice
              example of how moving between modes of implementation can sometimes
              mislead us.)

        <title>Democracy and Proportional Representation</title>
          <introduction>
            <p>
              Regardless of how deeply unjust and violent the current state 
              of the USA might be, and has arguably
              always been, at its founding it was based in certain principles, 
              including which was an idea about
              proportionality in decision making. In particular, an idea that 
              if states were to be represented in a legislative body, then
              those states should (sometimes) have that representation
              scaled by the population of that state. From the start, this 
              was a contested idea for many reasons, both because there 
              was no agreement on who counted as part of population and 
              related questions of how to handle the enslaved population. 
              If enslaved persons were counted as part of the population
              even though they had no practical voice in decision-making, then
              those who enslaved them would be granted extra power within
              the decision-making bodies of the young nation. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea of a representative legislative body itself offers a 
              good lens on the idea of democracy itself. If we have a state with
              100,000 people, we could make decisions by allowing each person to
              vote directly on every decision. You can see that this might be
              rather unwieldy in practice, but there would be, in a sense,
              no distortion at all. Every person is directly represented in
              the decision-making process; each person represents themself. 
              At the other extreme, we could select (by vote or by lottery) 
              one person to make the decisions for all 100,000 people. This
              allows the one person to swiftly make decisions, but we might 
              be disturbed that this person is now a dictator, at least until
              a new person is selected. So all representative bodies in between 
              are aimed at greater efficiency than everyone voting directly and
              more nuance and less total control than the one-person-in-charge
              version. But how do we do this in a fair and reasonable way?
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find official 
              descriptions of the four methods at the US 
              Census Bureau. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Suppose you have four states<mdash/>Mardi, Omoo, Pierre, 
              Redburn<mdash/>who wish to form a representative 
              legislative body with the number of representatives proportional
              to the states' populations. The populations are 30,000 in Mardi,
              40,000 in Omoo, 
              50,000 in Pierre, 
              and 70,000 in Redburn. The legislative body is to have 101
              representatives. (Perhaps the odd number was chosen 
              to avoid ties.) How would
              you suggest that this country go about doing this?
            </p>
            <p>
              A reasonable way to start is to consider proportions. Keep in mind
              the ways we have attempted to think about fairness previously. 
              What would it mean to match proportions in this case? We 
              need to recognize what proportion of population each state has.
              For that we also need total population and then we can use the 
              pattern or template we noted above.     
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>First idea: representatives are cookies to distribute to 
                population.</em>
              Let us put it another way: we want to distribute 101 cookies to 190,000
              people. In this view, we are trying to understand how much of a
              representative does each person get representing them in the
              legislative body?

            <question>
              <p>
                If we find this number, what would be the
                next logical step for finding how many representatives each
                state should have in the legislature?
              </p>
            </question>
            <answer>
              <p>
                If we have determined how much of a <q>cookie</q> each person
                gets, then we can just see how many people are in a state and
                add up all the (parts of) cookies that should be in that state.
                That is, if we have determined how much of a <q>representative</q> 
                each person is represented by,
                then we can just see how many people are in a state and
                add up all the (parts of) a representative that should be
                in the legislature from that state.
              </p>

            <p>
              <em>Second idea: people are cookies to distribute to 
                representatives.</em>
              Let us put it another way: we want to distribute 190,000 people to
              101 representatives. In this view, we are trying to understand how
              many people should each representative represent. 
              Question: if we find this number, what would be the

            <title>The Hamilton and Jefferson Methods of Apportionment</title>
            <introduction>
              <p>  
                Two early methods are labeled by names that will be familiar to you
                if you have brought into yourself historical knowledge of the forming
                of the United States of America. 
                Let us begin with the <em>Hamilton Method of Apportionment</em>.
              </p>
            </introduction>
            <subsection xml:id="subsec-hamilton">
              <title>The Hamilton Method</title>
              <p>
                The challenge for the so-called <q>Founding Fathers</q> was that in 
                most situations where the population of states was different from each 
                other, and with most numbers of representatives in the legislative body,
                there would be the need to determine how to round off answers. Hamilton
                suggested the following approach:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Find the number of people each representative should represent,
                      if only the division could be accomplished perfectly.
                      We call this the <term>divisor</term>. How should it be computed? 
                      Take the full population and divide it by the number of representatives
                      in the legislature. So, 
                      <m>
                        d=\frac{\text{total population}}{\text{number of legislators}}
                      </m>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Now take each state<rsq/>s population and divide it by the divisor,
                      keeping only the whole number part which we call the
                      <term>initial quota</term>. Note that each state must 
                      be given at least one representative, even if the number computed 
                      above is smaller than 1.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If the sum of these initial quotas is equal to the size of the
                      legislature, then we have determined the proper representation for
                      each state. If it is fewer representatives than the total (this is
                      the most common occurrence) then you look at the decimal portion
                      from each initial quota and award another representative 
                      to the state with largest decimal part. Continue awarding 
                      additional representatives to the next largest decimal part
                      until the total number of representatives is equal to the
                      size of the legislature. This is the <term>final quota</term>
                      for each state.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <example>
                <p>
                  It is often important to think about what limitations there might
                  be on how an algorithm might function. In this case, the insistence
                  (which seems relatively innocent) that every state receive at least one
                  representative could potentially cause a breakdown. Consider a seven-state 
                  country with one state with 30,000 people and the other six states all
                  the same size of 500 people. If we had a 30-representative legislature, 
                  then the algorithm above would give 27 representatives to the large state
                  and one representative each to the other six states, for a total of 33
                  representatives. But this is too many for the legislature! This
                  requires a sort of addendum to the process, of the sort we generally like
                  to avoid in algorithms like this. We could just say, well, the large state
                  only gets 24 and that fixes the problem, but might this also happen with
                  two large states and 12 small states? Then where do the spare representatives
                  come from? And if the two large states aren't quite the same size? You can 
                  see how quickly things become complicated. Consideration of these <q>edge</q> or
                  <q>extreme</q> cases is important in any exploration of the mathematical
                  behavior of such systems.
                </p>

            <subsection xml:id="subsec-jefferson">
              <title>The Jefferson Method</title>
              <p>
                The enslaver Thomas Jefferson, who systematically sexually assaulted 
                some of the people he enslaved, objected to the Hamilton Method. This was
                perhaps partially based on the fact that
                the apportionment that it produced violated a specific numerical insistence
                in the Constitution, that no representative should represent more than 30,000
                people. We shall see he may also have had some ulterior motives for a 
                different method of apportionment. He suggested the following approach:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Compute the divisor and then the initial quota as in the Hamilton Method.
                      If the initial quota provides the correct number of representatives, then
                      you are done.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If there are too few representatives, we will try a smaller divisor.
                      A smaller divisor has the potential to increase one or more of the
                      states<rsq/> quotas. (Once again you keep only the whole number portion.)
                      If the sum of the resulting quotas is equal to the required number
                      of representatives, then the process is concluded.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If there are too many representatives, we will try a larger divisor. 
                      A larger divisor has the potential to decrease one or more of the 
                      states<rsq/> quotas. If the sum of the resulting quotas is equal to the
                      required number of representatives then the process is concluded.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The process may need to iterate a few times to conclude. Keeping a list
                      of attempted divisors and whether they resulted in too many or too few 
                      representatives will help to avoid extra work. (Why?)
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                You will notice that the Jefferson Method, unlike the Hamilton Method, has
                a more open-ended process. You might have heard the sort of process required
                in the latter phase as <q>guess-and-check</q>. We have tried to include 
                enough rationale and intuitive description so that we might at least hope
                it to be, for you, <q>educated-guess-and-check</q>. If you look at your list
                of attempted divisors, what you should see is a sequence of numbers that is
                progressively working its way in towards the final divisor that worked, often
                from both above and below. Note also that this <q>final divisor</q> isn't 
                unique. If you and a friend work through the process and check your answer
                at the end, you should both find the same final quota for each state, but 
                your final divisor might be different (though probably not all
                <em>that</em> different).

            <title>Paradoxes</title>
            <introduction>
              <p>
                We will explore two more methods of apportionment. But why? Are not
                two methods already one more than we need? This is another occasion
                where we can learn from unexpected behaviors of complex systems.
                What if we designed a system, using our intuition, to accomplish
                a task, but then we find that in practice, despite our care in 
                designing the system, we find unexpected possible outcomes, possibly
                even outcomes that offend our intuition about how the system behaves?
                This sort of behavior is sometimes called a <term>paradox</term>. 
                Though the use of this term in cases like this is slightly at odds with 
                its technical and historical meaning in logic and philosophy, we will 
                retain it to mean, for us, 
                <q>
                  behaviors that our system exhibit but which offend our sense of
                  how the system ought, based on our intended design, to behave
                </q>.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will consider three examples from US history,
                The Alabama Paradox, the Population Paradox, and the New State Paradox.

            <title>The Webster and Huntington-Hill Methods of Apportionment</title>
            <introduction>
              <p>
                We may proceed through the remaining methods of apportionment
                more quickly. The fundamental concepts in place above are 
                only slightly altered in the following approaches. With both
                Hamilton and Jefferson methods, the driving idea was finding 
                the divisor, then finding a way to apportion the remaining
                representatives after whole numbers have been given. For the
                remaining two methods, the Webster Method and the Huntington-Hill
                Method, the second of which is still (as of 2025) being used 
                by the USA, the approach involves adjustment of the divisor,
                similar to the Jefferson Method, combined with a system of 
                rounding to whole numbers. In both Hamilton and Jefferson 
                methods, recall that we round down (or <term>truncate</term>)
                the result of dividing the population by the divisor. For
                the Webster Method, we simply round to the nearest whole 
                number in the usual way: by rounding down if the fractional
                portion is less than 0.5 and rounding up if the fractional
                portion is larger than 0.5. (In the unlikely event that the
                fractional portion is exactly 0.5, the usual rule is to round
                up.) For Huntington-Hill Method, the boundary for rounding
                up is made more generous. We will explore this in detail
                in examples.

      <chapter xml:id="ch-weighted-voting">
        <title>Power in Weighted Voting Systems</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            All of the effort put into the systems described in 
            the previous chapter were premised upon an
            intuitive idea: that if a state has, for example, 
            twice the representatives, then it will have
            twice the power in the House of Representatives. But 
            remember: one of the overarching themes of
            this book is that we want to be able to use 
            mathematics and its related fields to investigate 
            whether our intuitive ideas about how things 
            work are, in fact, accurate. We have already seen
            some examples of how this can happen. But the 
            belief related to this idea of power is quite
            surprising and can be motivated with a 
            relatively simple example.
          </p>
        </introduction>
        <section xml:id="formalizing-weighted">
          <title>A Motivating Example and Formalizing Weighted Voting</title>
          <example xml:id="ex-weighted-intuition">
            <title>Intuition Misleading Us?</title>
            <p>
              Suppose there were three states in the 
              nation with populations such that, 
              in the 100-member House
              of Representatives, one state, Alsaka, had 49 representatives, 
              one state, Bartleby, had 47 representatives, and a third
              state, Cropland, had four representatives. 
              Let us further assume that these numbers of representatives are
              proportional to population. 
              (For example, this would be exactly true if the populations were 49,000, 
              47,000, and 4000, respectively.) 
              So according to the intuition we have
              been basing our work on up until now, 
              this system has been constructed 
              in a way that is fair. It has explicitly 
              and exactly matched the proportion of 
              numbers of representatives to the proportion 
              of the number of people in the
              population for each state. 
              The state that has 49% of the population has
              49% of the representatives, the state that 
              has 47% of the population has 47% of
              the representatives, and the state that 
              has 4% of the population has 4% of 
              the representatives.
              (If you look back at examples and exercises from 
              <xref ref="ch-democracy-representation"/> you will notice that in practice
              it will almost never happen that these proportions match so exactly. We have, 
              in a sense, imagined what seems to be a rather ideal situation for fairness
              in the proportional representation of these states in this legislative body.)
              Our intuition has told us and our justification for all
              the work in <xref ref="ch-democracy-representation"/> is based on the idea that
              this should preserve those proportions, as well, in terms of decision-making
              power. That is, if you have 49% of the representatives, you should have
              roughly 49% of the decision-making power, similarly 47% of the representatives
              should give you 47% of the decision-making power, and 4% of the representatives
              should give you 4% of the decision-making power.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we proceed further, if you were to guess how powerful each state was
              in the legislature, what would you say? Does it match the percentages
              described above? Or is the state with 49,000 people twice
              as powerful as the state with 4000 people? Five times as powerful? (Note: you
              should not feel bad if you have only a vague sense of this. <q>Power</q> is
              a concept that we have not carefully defined. Indeed, that is the point of this
              section, to develop a coherent approach to thinking mathematically about 
              how power might be quantified in such situations.)
            </p>
            <p>
              So let us suppose that these states have quite distinct populations and, further,
              let us suppose that each state delegation is disciplined and loyal and always
              votes together as a group. (If you think this changes your idea of the power of
              each state, that seems reasonable to me. Interesting how quickly assumptions
              and constraints change our ideas about how a system works, no?)
            </p>
            <p>
              How do things play out? Well let us think it through: Suppose the proposed
              measure that this legislative body is deliberating upon is whether to 
              locate a (necessary?) toxic
              waste dump in Cropland. We might expect this to be approved by the 49
              representatives from Alsaka and the 47 from Bartleby, which would allow
              the measure to pass by majority vote. (Note that there is another assumption
              here, one we might do well to (re)consider later, namely that simple majority,
              which in this case would be 51 out of 100, is all that is needed to
              pass a measure.) Obviously 96 votes will suffice to pass the measure.
              That is to say: if both Alsaka and Bartleby favor a measure, then that 
              measure will be approved by the legislative body. 
            </p>
            <p>
              But suppose, instead, that a measure were introduced to place the 
              waste dump in Alsaka? Why, then we might expect that Bartleby and
              Cropland could agree to vote in favor of this measure, which would
              thus pass by a 51 to 49 count. A measure passed by 51 to 49 is just as
              binding as a measure passed by 96 to 4. This fact turns out to have
              a rather interesting consequence. In fact, we can now notice the 
              following key fact: 
              <em>
                If two of the three states are in favor of a measure, then
                the measure will pass.
              </em>
              This may be quite surprising, even disturbing. Especially since
              it shows that our intuition about the scaling of representatives
              to population might completely fail to scale the decision-making
              power in the way we had hoped. Alsaka has the same amount of 
              power in this system as Cropland does, despite the fact that its
              population is over 12 times bigger. A citizen of Alsaka has 
              less than 
              <m>
                \frac{1}{12}
              </m>
              the amount of power as a citizen of Cropland. It is not unreasonable
              to think that over time this sort of distortion away from 
              <q>equal representation</q> might have rather significant effects
              upon the views citizens might have of the legitimacy of the 
              political system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that we have different ways we might think of the power
              in this system and how it is distributed. Based on previous
              ways we have been thinking about such things, we might
              choose to think of there being 100% of power that must be 
              distributed. Then in this case we would say that each 
              state has roughly 33.3% of the power. We could similarly 
              declare that all the power adds to 1 and say that each
              state has power measured at 0.333. 
            </p>
            <aside>
              <p>
                There is nothing preventing us from declaring there to be
                any amount of power which must be distributed. We might 
                set up our analysis such that 45 <q>power units</q> are 
                available to be distributed in the system. Then our analysis
                would conclude in this case that each state has 15 power
                units. But can you see how this is really just introducing a
                rather arbitrary additional number into the process? Is this
                not rather less illuminating to say that Cropland has 15
                of the 45 power units? It is easier just to say it has 33.3%
                of the power or 0.333 of the power.
              </p>
            </aside>
          </example>
          <p>
            Before we move on to a more systematic approach to computing power
            within a system like this, let us first notice how sensitive such 
            a system might be to changes in the conditions of the population.
          </p>
          <example>
            <p>
              Suppose a decade passes, and during that time
              1500 people move from State Bartleby to Alsaka and 
              500 from Cropland to Alsaka (but all other births and deaths
              cancel out so the only changes are these relocations). Now what?
            </p>

          </example>
          <p>
            In a rather beautiful demonstration of the fact that math and
            quantitative reasoning are creative processes, there are two 
            main approaches to computing the power available to each state
            in a system like this. The numbers they produce are sometimes the
            same but often are not. Each conceives of what matters in a different
            way, which we will summarize as the power in saying no and the 
            power in saying yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            One final task before we begin: the terminology and assumptions
            we will use throughout the following analysis. To achieve a sort 
            of generality of application, we will abstract slightly from the 
            descriptions above. Rather than states we will think of 
            <term>players</term> in a <term>weighted voting system</term>. 
            Each player will have a <term>weight</term>, and the system
            itself will have a <term>quota</term>, which is the required
            total weight of players required to pass a measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make this clear, in <xref ref="ex-weighted-intuition"/>, 
            there are
            three players, Alsaka with weight 49, Bartleby with weight 47, 
            and Cropland with weight 4. The quota in that example is 51. We 
            always require that the quota exceed half the total weight of the 
            system. (Why must we insist on this? How would the system potentially
            break down if we failed to require this?) Our notation for such a
            system will be: 
            <me>

          <title>The Power of No</title>
          <p>
            Our purpose in this section is to explore how we might measure
            power in a weighted voting system by the ability to say 
            <q>No!</q> to a measure and for that <q>No!</q> to matter. An 
            easy first step is to say that if it were impossible that a 
            <q>No!</q> from some player could matter, then this player
            has no power in the system. We might also say that player has
            zero power. We call such a player a <term>dummy</term>.          
          </p>
          <p>
            At the other end of this spectrum, if there is some player
            with so much weight that if they say <q>No!</q> to a measure
            then that measure can never pass, we say this player has
            <term>veto power</term> in the system. You may think that
            such a player must have all the power in the system, but 
            this is actually not the case.
          </p>
          <example xml:id="ex-veto">
            <p>
              Consider the weighted voting system <m>[4:3,2,1]</m>.
              Since Player 2 and Player 3 only add to a total weight of 3, 
              this means they cannot pass a measure without Player 1. 
              Thus, Player 1 has veto power. But notice that Player 1 cannot
              pass a measure on their own, because their weight is also
              3, which is less than the quota, <m>q=4</m>. Neither Player 2
              nor Player 3 have veto power. But it also seems they may not
              be a dummies. (We will develop our abilities further to explore
              this question.)
            </p>
          </example>
          <p>
            It turns out that it is possible that more than one player 
            might have veto power within a system:
          </p>
          <example xml:id="ex-veto-multiple">
            <p>
              Consider the weighted voting system <m>[6:4,3,1]</m>. If
              we think about what is required to pass a measure in this 
              system, we see that Player 1 is needed, but so is Player 2.
              Player 1 and Player 3, even if they agree, do not reach
              the total weight required by the quota <m>q=6</m>. Similarly,
              Player 2 and Player 3, even if they agree, do not reach
              the quota. Thus,
              both Player 1 and Player 2 have veto power in this system.
              If either Player 1 or Player 2 say no to a measure, it will
              not pass.
              (It may be the case, now, that Player 3 is indeed a dummy.
              But we need, still, to develop our tools to be able to 
              explore this.)
            </p>
          </example>
          <p>
            In order to systematically explore the Power of No (more
            usually called 
            <q>the Banzhaf power index</q>) we need to introduce the idea
            of a <term>winning coalition</term>. A winning coalition is any
            set of players which can pass a measure; that is, a winning 
            coalition is any set of players whose total weight meets or exceeds
            the quota.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other key idea to introduce is a <term>critical player</term>.
            A critical player in a winning coalition is any player who, if they
            leave the winning coalition, that coalition no longer has enough
            weight to pass a measure and is, thus, no longer a winning coalition.
            It is precisely this fact that leads us to call this way of thinking
            about power as <q>the Power of No</q>, since our method is tallying
            how often it is that a player changing their mind and saying <q>no</q>
            would matter.

                    the total number
                    of times that any player was critical. 
                    That is, the Banzhaf power, 
                    the Power of No, for Player <m>i</m> is defined to be:

          <p>
            Note that if we compute the Power of No for each player in this way, 
            the sum of all the powers is 1. Can you see why this is? Can you 
            convince yourself this is true? 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also worth remembering that instead of 1 we could think of this as 100%,
            and thus we can see that this approach is essentially imagining there to be 
            some total amount of power, thought as 100%, which is then distributed
            amongst the players. Banzhaf power index, then, is one way of describing 
            how that 100% of power is distributed amongst the players. 
          </p>
          <p>
            What is quite interesting is that this is not the only way to think about 
            measuring power in such a system. But before we move on to another method,
            let us work through an example.

          <title>The Power of Yes</title>
          <p>
            Suppose we find this focus on no-saying to be too negative. What
            if we were to try to measure how often saying yes might matter? 
            This immediately presents certain conceptual challenges. To motivate
            the approach we will use, it may be useful to imagine the proposal, 
            in the legislative body, of a measure that is very popular with
            the population as a whole. If we imagine all the ways that the
            players within the weighted voting system might raise their hands
            to indicate that they approve this measure, we could focus on 
            precisely when the entire gallery of optimistic and hopeful onlookers
            might erupt into jubilant applause, knowing that, yes, the measure
            will pass. This is the lens that we will use to develop the idea
            of the Power of Yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As before, we need to define a couple terms. First, rather than 
            building winning coalitions, in this case we imagine all the possible
            orderings of the players. That is, we can imagine all the possible
            orderings of them raising their hands in favor of the measure. 
            We will not consider the possibility of two raising their hands at 
            the same instant. (From what we know of physics and the nature of 
            time this would be impossible anyway.) We will call these possible
            orderings <term>sequential coalitions</term>. Note, though, that
            unlike in the previous case, we do not consider any ordering that
            does not include all the players. There are technical reasons for 
            this, but perhaps we might suggest a psychological-political reason 
            for this as well, that once it becomes clear a measure will pass 
            and also that it is popular, perhaps the remaining players choose
            to also vote in favor of the measure to, so to speak, 
            <q>
              be on the right side of history
            </q>. 
            (We shall note, here, again, that there are plenty of times
            in history that deeply immoral measures have been passed to
            great popular applause.) Within each sequential coalition
            we will be trying to identify the <term>pivotal player</term>, 
            which is the player in the ordered list whose added weight, 
            within the system, moves the measure from <q>not yet approved</q>
            to <q>approved</q>.
          </p>
          <remark>
            <title>A remark on counting:</title>
            <p>
              Though producing a list of all the sequential coalitions can
              be a somewhat arduous task, we can at least say, from the start,
              how many we must produce. This helps us to make sure we
              have not failed to list some ordering
              orderings which would doom our computation of the Power of Yes 
              from the start. (For more on the ideas introduced here, you can
              read <xref ref="sec-counting-techniques"/>.)
            </p>
            <p>
              How many orderings are there of one object? Just one. What
              about orderings of two objects, call them <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. 
              Well, we can order them <m>AB</m> or <m>BA</m>, correct? 
              What about ordering three objects: A, B, and C?
              <md>
                <mrow>ABC</mrow>
                <mrow>ACB</mrow>
                <mrow>BAC</mrow>
                <mrow>BCA</mrow>
                <mrow>CAB</mrow>
                <mrow>CBA</mrow>
              </md>
              Six possible orderings. 
            </p>
            <p>
              What you might notice in that last example is 
              that we can think of this as a process playing out in 
              stages. How many choices are there for the first object
              in the ordering? Three choices. Now, once you've selected
              the first, how many choices are there for the second
              in line? Only two choices left. Then the remaining object
              must be last in line. This means there are 
              <m>(3)(2)(1)=6</m> orderings. And if there were four objects?
              Then there would be <m>(4)(3)(2)(1)=24</m> orderings.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can see that this swiftly becomes cumbersome to write out,
              and so a notation has been created, factorial notation, which 
              uses the exclamation point, <q>!</q>. So instead of writing 
              <m>(3)(2)(1)</m> we can write <m>3!</m>. And instead of writing
              <m>(4)(3)(2)(1)</m> we can write <m>4!</m>. This is such a
              fundamental idea, and so natural, that as you become more familiar
              with these topics you may find yourself automatically thinking
              of <m>n!</m> as <q>the number of ways to order <m>n</m> objects</q>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's worth noting, also, that <m>5!=(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)=120</m> and 
              <m>6!=(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)=720</m>. So once we get to analysis of power
              in a weighted voting system with six or more players, we have a 
              rather strenuous task to perform! (There are ways to cleverly save
              ourselves some work, but they require care and practice. For most
              of our analyses in this book, we will keep things on a more reasonable
              scale. There are also online tools available to carry out this sort of 
              power analysis for us. We are working through the details so you can
              intuitively understand <em>how</em> those processes work, not so much
              so that you will drag yourself through onerous and extended power
              calculations by hand.)

        <introduction>
          <p>
            Much of what we have considered so far can be seen as attempts
            to make things <q>fair</q> or <q>just</q>. We seem to have, as
            humans, many ideas about what is fair or not. We have already
            seen several situations where a design that seems well-suited
            to generate fair or just outcomes has instead exhibited behavior
            that surprised us for its deviation from what seemed fair.
            These ideas of fairness so far have tended to be associated with
            ideas of proportion. We have been pursuing proportionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this section, we will examine something different. We will
            concern ourselves with how elections might be best carried out. 
            That is, if we must choose among two or more candidates 
            for some position, 
            or between two or more possible options for solving a problem,
            how should we choose?
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people will immediately arrive at an answer that we should 
            reflect upon. We should have a vote, they say. Surely, this is the 
            very heart of democracy! But <q>democracy</q> is itself a word that
            gathers into it quite a multiplicity of ideas and ideological 
            commitments or assumptions. And, as we have seen before, even if
            we design a system from correct intuitions we must carefully examine
            the behavior of that system to understand whether those intuitions
            about good design do indeed then generate the fair or just or proportional
            behaviors we had envisioned.

        <section xml:id="sec-voting-notation">
          <title>The Will of the Voters</title>
          <p>
            Right away as we think about elections and voting, we are 
            introduced to a sort of abstract idea, which is the 
            <q>will of the voters</q>. (We will set aside, for now, 
            the terribly fraught question of who the voters are, 
            a problem which we might plausibly argue
            has never actually been solved in a truly just way.) 
            But if an election, some collective act of voting, is a 
            process designed to make a decision, should it not also be
            designed for that decision to be most pleasing to the most
            people who voted in that election? For any question, it 
            seems reasonable to imagine some ideal <q>will of the people</q>
            which the method for tallying votes is designed to reveal.
          </p>
          <example xml:id="ex-pizza-vote">
            <title>Choosing Pizza</title>
            <p>
              12 children are choosing what kind of pizza they want
              for a birthday party. (The large pizza from this particular
              pizzeria has 12 pieces.) The options are cheese, pepperoni,
              or olive and onion. Five vote for cheese, four vote for 
              pepperoni, and three vote for olive and onion. So they 
              each get a piece of cheese pizza. Sounds like everything
              worked out as it should.
            </p>
            <p>
              But let us think through this more carefully. What if the
              five who wanted cheese had olive and onion as their 
              second choice? What if the four who wanted pepperoni also
              had olive and onion as their second choice? Does this
              still seem like a good outcome? We now know that seven of
              the 12 children will be eating the pizza that is their
              last choice. On the other hand, if olive and onion had
              been ordered, then everyone would be eating either their
              first or second choice of pizza. It seems that, at least
              from certain points of view and with certain distributions
              of the opinions of voters, our decision to focus only on
              the top choice of ever voter might still lead to outcomes
              that are not in alignment with <q>the will of the people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are tempted to object to this, note that another way 
              we might have approached the situation: the children should
              vote on which pizza option should be eliminated first. Clearly
              cheese pizza would have been eliminated, since seven children,
              a majority (which term we will explore in detail later) would 
              have voted to eliminate cheese pizza. (Can you see what pizza
              would then be chosen if this process was repeated with the two
              remaining pizza options?)
            </p>
            <p>
              You might also object, here, and say, well, those are two different
              methods, it should not surprise us, nor even perhaps disturb us,
              that they result in a different outcome. This is a good point! 
              All that this example really does is suggest that perhaps there
              might be some work to be done, mathematically, analytically, to
              think through how we might evaluate the effectiveness and fairness
              of voting methods. There seems to be at least some ambiguity about
              what might best (and thus most fairly?) reflect the will of the 
              people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, though we will work to discern methods for discerning
              the will of the people, we should remember that a decision that 
              accurately reflects the will of the people may not, by that fact, 
              be affirmed as morally good. You will see this sometimes to be 
              assumed in discussions of democracy and voting. But we would do
              well to recall that, at many times in the past, great evil has 
              been affirmed or assented to by democratic processes. Consider
              the American South prior to 1865, the United States
              prior to 1964. Or consider Germany in 1933. At many times, the
              majority has not only incorrect but morally repugnant beliefs
              and practices. We may hope that democracy blunts or minimizes the
              chance of these sorts of outcomes, but we must not be naive.
            </p>
          </example>
          <p>
            In order to clearly think through this analysis, we need to develop 
            some notation. How are we to capture the preferences of some 
            finite collection of voters among some finite list of options,
            whether they be candidates or types of pizza to order?

                A preference schedule for some set of voters collects the

              It completely summarizes the ballots cast by the 12 children

              number of ballots of that type. The rows correspond to first-,
              second-, and third-choices on those ballots. We will generally
              include the first column to remind us that this is what 
              these rows mean. Note that the sum of numbers in the first
              row should always correspond to the total number of votes cast.
              In this case, <m>5+4+3=12</m>.

          <p>
            Such a table can be easily extended to as many rows as necessary.
            It is good to think about how many columns might be needed, though.
            With three candidates, we would never need more than six columns.
            Can you see why? It depends on the number of possible orderings 
            of three candidates. If there were four candidates, the number of
            possible orderings of candidates rises to 24. With five candidates
            we might have 120 possible kinds of ballots cast. In all these 
            cases we can still carry out the analyses that we will develop 
            below. But you can see that the space of possible outcomes rises
            quite rapidly. (This is called the combinatorial explosion, and we 
            will speak more about it in later sections.)

            In <xref ref="ex-pizza-vote"/> we may have already begun to suspect
            that we will need to be quite careful about how we think about what
            the behavior of a voting method should be. The usual approach to this
            question is to declare our ideas of fairness in an election. There
            are many such <q>fairness criteria</q> that are suggested and 
            studied. We will focus our attention on four of them.

            <p>
              We will now declare, as carefully as possible, our ideas
              about what should happen in a voting method that is fair.
              By naming these ideas of fairness, we will be defining
              parameters for us to use in judging existing or future
              methods of voting. The process of determining whether a
              method of voting will always satisfy some criterion can

              voters or the participation of candidates might change in 
              particular ways.

          <title>Four Voting Methods</title>
          <introduction> 
            <p>
              With the the ideas of fairness defined by the four Fairness
              Criteria above, let us now explore some methods of determining
              a winner in an election, once we have been provided with a 
              preference schedule summarizing voter opinion on the candidates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two other things to keep in mind: first, that none of the following
              analysis is needed if there are only two candidates. 
              When there are only two candidates, the problems we are seeking
              to solve do not arise. (But notice that preventing more than two
              candidates from pursuing office might indeed be anti-democratic. 
              We should not assume that we may easily avoid complexity or paradox
              by ruling out, in advance, full participation of all those who would
              like to seek to serve in office.)
              Second, though
              we will consider situations where each ballot provides a complete
              ranking of all the candidates, there are simple ways to adapt the
              results we will find to account for ballots with incomplete information.
              That is, an objection that not all voters would fill out their ballot
              completely and therefore no alternative methods should be considered
              is an invalid objection. (It is somewhat common to hear objections to
              alternative methods of voting, usually relying upon claims about the 
              ignorance or laziness of voters. Ignorance and laziness in voting, when
              they occur, are, in the opinion of this author, likely to be the effect
              of poor voting methods and legislative and executive leaders who fail
              to address the real-world material needs of voters.)
            </p>
          </introduction>
          <subsection xml:id="subsec-plurality">
            <title>The Plurality Method</title>
            <p>
              The Plurality Method likely needs little introduction. It
              is the most familiar method to most people who have lived
              within democratic processes. It is very simple to set up, 
              explain, and determining a winner is also quite straightforward.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, as we will see, it is quite prone to some
              rather serious problems. If you remember nothing else from all 
              that follows, please remember this: the Plurality Method, despite
              its ease of use, should be replaced by other methods if the goal
              is to avoid rather serious negative behaviors. We will
              see why this is so.
            </p>

                      <p>
                        Whichever candidate has received the most

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        If there is a tie between two or more candidates with
                        the most first-place votes, the tie should be broken
                        using a predetermined tiebreak method. (This could be
                        to declare the winner is the one 
                        with the most second-place votes (and if that is also a
                        tie using the third-place votes to break the tie, etc.), or
                        could be determined by using one of the other 
                        voting methods.)

            </algorithm>
            <p>
              You can see that this is indeed a very simple method. In
              fact, voters need not even think about who their second or
              third or lower choices might be. In the USA this sort of 
              indifference to lower choices has become so ingrained
              as to feel almost natural. But even if your favorite candy
              is a Theo chocolate bar, surely it matters whether your
              second choice is Necco Wafers or Skittles? Most of us
              have gradations of preference for most things, and perhaps
              it behooves us to be informed enough to learn these 
              preferences when it comes to organizing our preferences and
              practices around who gets food, housing, and whether we
              should engage in war or support the starvation of children
              in the name of freedom and justice and democracy.
            </p>

        <title>Distortion of Representation: Gerrymandering</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            In our personal relationships, it is important to establish
            boundaries. In the political or legal realm the ability to 
            establish boundaries is a great power. Our ideas of fairness 
            might also have something to say here. As in so many situations
            we have already examined, we will once again be leaning on 
            our intuition about proportionality to see if we can identify
            outcomes that seem troubling or even unfair or unjust.
          </p>
          <p>
            This text is being written from within the United States of America. 
            This has driven many of the previous discussions and their examples. 
            In this chapter, to avoid too much emotional interaction with the 
            party particulars of the USA, the idea of political gerrymandering will
            be explored using two imaginary parties: the Purple Party and the 
            Orange party. Of course, what this means is we are still operating within
            an imagined situation where there are two major parties. Many countries
            have more than two major parties. Obviously, in such a case there will
            be even more complex dynamics. As we explore the ways that the establishment
            of boundaries may distort representation in a two-party situation, 
            keep in mind what might or might not carry over to the multi-party case.
            We should also state outright that none of our analysis and attention
            should be taken as any sort of endorsement of the two-party approach. 
            (We might want to allow for the case, though, that our analysis might
            lead us to the opposite of an endorsement of such a system. Perhaps.)

        </introduction>
        <section xml:id="sec-gerry-motivation">
          <title>What Would Distortion Look like?</title>
          <p>
            What could go wrong? As so often, we will begin with an example. To keep
            things easier to contemplate, let us assume that the entire population
            is eligible to vote and does vote in every election. 
            Let us further assume that all are 
            registered as either Purple Party or Orange Party, and that they are quite
            loyal to their parties. (If you are thinking that this is a strong set
            of assumptions, you are correct. Reflect a bit on whether, even so, the
            insights we might gain would still apply to the more complex real-world
            situation in the USA circa 2025.)
          </p>
          <example>
            <title>Purple Favoring Itself</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                The state of Omoo has 120,054 people in it, and thus
                should be represented in the nation's 
                proportional-representation legislature by four representatives.
                The state government is currently controlled by the Purple Party, 
                which has the responsibility, now, to draw the borders for the
                legislative districts which will be represented in the national
                legislature.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If the population is made up of 61,043 Purple voters and 
                      59,011 Orange voters, what would be the most fair way for 
                      this state to be represented in the national legislature?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Is it possible that the boundaries be drawn so that the
                      Purple Party gets three or even all four representatives?
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Most fair would be two representatives for each party.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Yes, the Purple Party could have between 1 and 4 
                      representatives in the legislature. The Orange Party 
                      could have between 0 and 3 representatives. 
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>

            <solution>
              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      This is very similar to problems we have solved in earlier
                      chapters. Since the Purple Party has 50.8% of the population
                      and the Orange Party has 49.2% of the population, a 50% to 
                      50% split of the representatives seems more fair than a 75%
                      to 25% (or 100% to 0%) split.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      We will explore visual expressions of this idea later,
                      but aiming at roughly equal populations in each district (which
                      is how the USA system works) and depending on the actual spatial
                      distribution of the Purple and Orange voters, it is be possible that the
                      Purple Party wins all four districts each by a narrow margin. 
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
            Now, you might respond, <q>So what?</q> There are close election
            results all the time! Why should we worry if Purple manages four
            close wins? True. And this is precisely what makes analysis of this
            sort of question quite challenging and tricky. How can we get a handle
            on when something is simply a result of random processes and the messy
            churn of human thought and action? Should we always just assume that
            things are essentially unbiased and safe? Or would it be more prudent
            to develop the tools and habits of investigation and reflection?
          </p>
          <p>
            We should not minimize, though, the challenge here. As we move into 
            the analysis of ever more complex systems, we also enter into situations
            where outcomes can be explained by a variety of factors, some of which
            are simply randomness and chance, others of which might be orchestrated
            by other humans or processes. This also means we may need to be more 
            sophisticated in how we reflect and investigate. For example, in the 
            situation described above, if the Purple Party won all four seats, each
            one by a narrow margin, after
            drawing the boundaries, we might want to find a way to look at the 
            map of the legislative districts themselves to help us decide whether 
            the districts made a certain natural sort of sense. How might we 
            recognize a map of district boundaries that didn't seem to <q>make sense</q>?
            What kind of tools would we have to develop to even speak coherently on 
            such a question?

        <section xml:id="sec-gerry-wasted">
          <title>One View on Distortion: Wasted Votes</title>
          <p>
            One approach to analysis of possible gerrymandering is to 
            investigate the idea of <term>wasted votes</term>. Though this
            term is expressive and easy to remember, it does seem to carry
            some negative connotation with it in the word <q>wasted</q>. 
            We can imagine a booster of democratic processes objecting to
            the word, some sort of naively hopeful 
            <q>no vote is every truly wasted</q> sentiment. It is pretty
            to hope so. It is also worth noting that the vague notion 
            of wasting a vote seems more likely to arise in precisely the
            sort of two-party system dominant in the USA, especially in
            those localities that still run their elections using the 
            Plurality Method discussed in 
            <xref ref="sec-voting-methods"/>. The idea of a 
            <q>wasted vote</q> loses coherent meaning in an election
            using the Instant Runoff Voting Method, or the 
            Borda Count Voting Method,  or the Pairwise Comparisons 
            Voting Method. Indeed, this seems one of the major
            commendable aspects of these methods in contradistinction 
            to the Plurality Voting Method.

        <section xml:id="sec-gerry-howto">
          <title>Distorting on Purpose: How to Gerrymander</title>
          <introduction>
            <p>
              Though the concept of wasted votes 
              and the Efficiency Gap measure derived from them can
              be powerful tools
              for motivating our exploration of how a system might fail
              to reflect the preference of a significant portion of voters,
              they have some limitations. For one, there will always be some
              votes that are not reflected in the results. That is the 
              nature of holding an election.
            </p>
            <p>
              The frequent absurdity of discourse around these topics 
              was brought into rather sharp focus in August 2025, when 
              a Republican, not content with the currently right-
              distorted state of the USA, complained 
              on a eugenics-inclined-billionaire-owned 
              social media site about the fact 
              that eight states have no Republican representation in
              the House of Representatives. Included in the list was 
              the apparently outrageous case of Vermont, which has 32% 
              of voters that vote Republican yet have zero Republicans
              in the House. Of course, Vermont has such a small population
              that it is apportioned only a single representative in 
              the House. Was the tweeter arguing that 32% should be 
              enough to claim that entire single representative for  
              the Republicans?
            </p>
            <p>
              The tool does require critical thinking, though.
              There are some subtleties to consider, though. It 
              is perhaps best to think of the Efficiency Gap defined 
              in the previous section as an alert that calls for more
              careful analysis of the boundaries drawn for
              the districts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As a simple example: in the USA there has been a series
              of demographic movements called the <q>Great Sort</q>, which
              essentially reflects people moving to places that they perceive
              to have a population whose political beliefs and/or values are
              more well aligned to their own. The person who chooses to move
              to rural Idaho and the person who chooses to move to the Capitol
              Hill neighborhood in Seattle will tend to have distinctly dissimilar
              political inclinations. (We are speaking only in tendencies and 
              generalities here, of course. Rather, we should say we are speaking
              of probabilities, about which we will speak at much greater length
              later.)
            </p>
            <p>
              The point, then, is that it would be good to be able to recognize,
              in the event of what seems to be possible irregularities, whether
              this has come to be from a sort of natural variation or rather
              has been engineered by those in control of drawing the boundaries.
              This sort of manipulation of boundaries to distort outcomes is 
              precisely the behavior that is meant by the word 
              <term>gerrymandering</term>.
            </p>
            <p>
              As is so often the case, an extremely effective 
              way to improve our ability
              to recognize when a system is being manipulated is
              to attempt to understand how we ourselves might 
              manipulate it, given the chance.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            You are enmeshed in a system that insists upon your compliance
            in order for you to continue to eat. Only willing subjects to
            this system are afforded the calories and nutrients that
            allow their physical and biological substrate to continue to 
            function. If this sounds coercive, you are correct. It is.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key implements of coercion and power in the 
            current world system is the monetary system and its associated
            practices of credit and debt. This financial system is 
            massively complex at this point, including huge portions that
            not only run on computers but are controlled by computers, 
            sometimes in ways few humans do <em>or even can</em> 
            understand. The basics of interest, debt, credit, and the time 
            value of money will be covered in this chapter, with the 
            intention that the careful learners emerge better able to 
            protect themselves from those with massive power within
            the system. That is, the very rich and the institutions they
            control.

            We will begin by introducing the concept of 
            <term>interest</term>, which is nothing more complex
            than a periodic proportional increase in an amount
            of money. Yet in practice what it becomes is a
            fee charged by those with more than enough
            money to live to those with less than enough money
            to live... to live.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will discuss this further once we have established
            the mechanics of the system. But keep this in mind as well:
            as we explore the logic and movement in this system, 
            remember always that it is a human system, contingent,
            changeable. Humanity has arranged its behavior and care
            for each other radically differently for the vast majority
            of human history.

            We will take the idea of money as given, though, again, 
            one must keep in mind that it is only a contingent set
            of human practices that allow it to so thoroughly organize
            our lives.

            Once money is posited as part of the system, as a sort of 
            universal unit of exchange that can provide access to
            goods and services, necessary and frivolous alike, the issue
            of time also presents itself. Specifically, how does (or 
            should?) time and money interact. One way is that you do 
            or will eventually trade away part of your life to your
            boss, a portion of each of your finite number of days, in 
            exchange for money. This money can, in theory, then be 
            used to provide food and shelter and medical care to you
            and those you love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this book, we have often found ourselves in 
            pursuit of equivalents. (Or <q>equivalence</q>.) Here we find
            another needed pursuit: suppose you need money right now and 
            someone else has that money. Further, that person does not 
            need the money they have for use right now. They could give
            the money to you for you to use for the needed food or housing
            or medical care. They might ask only for the same amount of money
            in return at some future (specified or unspecified) date. 
            This rarely occurs. Generally, a larger amount of future money is
            expected in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a variety of reasons that might be given for this
            expectation. We might even view some of them as, more or 
            less, reasonable. What we must never do is lose sight of the
            fact that any such reason runs the risk of becoming so encrusted,
            even completely obscured by habit and privilege, that it
            becomes an item of faith upon which the lives and well-being of
            vulnerable people will be sacrificed without hesitation. 
          </p>
          <p>
            So let us present the reasons that the future repayment might
            be expected to be larger than the original loan amount, wary and
            with full awareness of the ways
            these reasons can be used to justify privation, want, 
            and exploitation of vulnerable persons.

                  Risk: the borrower may not pay the agreed future
                  amount, either because they will not or cannot. Thus, 
                  the creditor should be compensated for taking this risk
                  and the amount repaid should be larger than that loaned.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Lost access to the loaned money: the creditor no 
                  longer has the use of the loaned money in the interval
                  between loaning it and being repaid. Thus, the creditor 
                  should be compensated for this decrease in their 
                  financial autonomy 
                  and the amount repaid should be larger than that loaned.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Inflation: historically, on average, the value of 
                  money has a tendency to decrease. This means a dollar now
                  tends to be able to purchase more than a dollar in a
                  month or a year or a decade. (when I was a teen, it cost
                  $7 to see an evening movie. Nowadays, a teen would watch
                  it free via torrent on their phone. But if they went to the
                  theater to see an evening movie it would cost around $15.) 
                  Since a dollar now will (usually) buy less than a dollar in 
                  the future, the creditor should be compensated to mitigate 
                  this decay in purchasing power
                  and the amount repaid should be larger than that loaned.

              Mary needs $100 to buy food for her four children. 
              Richard has $100 he is not using and will not need for a 
              month. He agrees to loan Mary money to feed her 
              children as long as she will pay him back an extra 
              10% at the end of the month. Mary has little choice 
              but to agree.
            </p>
            <p>
              How much does Mary pay at the end of the month? We
              know from what we learned in 
              <xref ref="ch-percent-proportion"/>
              that 10% of $100 is:

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-simple-interest">
            <title>Simple Interest</title>
            <p>
              Suppose you were to put money into a savings account at
              some financial institution. You should think of this as
              you giving a loan to this institution. We are often trained
              or expected to think of this as the institution doing us the
              favor of protecting our money. It is true that a bank tends
              to be more difficult to rob than a person with cash. But the 
              more important aspect of this exchange is that you are granting
              the institution the use of that money for some period of time
              until you take it out of the institution again. Thus, according 
              to the logic described above, the institution should pay you
              some interest for the use of this money. (We will later 
              discuss what benefit this has for the institution and what 
              <q>use</q> might mean in this context.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Suppose you place $1000 into this institution, which agrees
              to pay you a 1% interest payment on this amount for each
              month that you leave it in the bank. This interest payment
              would thus be:
              <me>
                (0.01)(1000)=10
              </me> 
              That is, the bank would pay you $10 at the end of the first
              month. If you left the $1000 in the bank for another month, 
              you would be given another $10 payment by the bank. And so
              on.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach to the practice is called <term>simple interest</term>
              and we would say you were earning monthly 1% simple interest. We can 
              even form a simple formula to summarize this situation. If you 
              deposit some amount <m>P_0</m> earning a per time period simple interest
              rate of <m>r</m> for <m>n</m> of these time periods, how much money, <m>P</m>,
              would you now be entitled to withdraw from the bank?
            </p>
            <p>
              You would be entitled to:
              <men>
                P=P_0+(n)(r)(P_0)=P_0+nrP_0=P_0(1+nr)
              </men>
              This is worth thinking through. But it should not be too confusing.
              Each time period that passes, the bank must give us a new amount based
              on a percentage of the <em>original</em> deposit, which is <m>P_0</m>.
              That amount is the same every time, <m>r \times P_0</m>. So if it has 
              been paid <m>n</m> times? Then <m>n \times r \times P_0</m> has been 
              added to the original amount of <m>P_0</m>. The other forms are all
              merely algebraic adjustments.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Marty places $600 into a bank which will pay them 4% simple
                  interest every two months. How much money can Marty take out
                  of this account if they leave it in the bank for eight months?
                </p>
              </statement>
              <answer>
                <p>
                  <me>
                    P=600(1+(0.04)(4))=696
                  </me>
                  That is, $696.
                </p>
              </answer>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  In one sense, we are simply plugging in the appropriate values
                  of the variables. Since $600 is deposited, this means that 
                  <m>P_0=600</m>. Since the simple interest rate for every two months
                  is 4%, we have <m>r=0.04</m>. We must be slightly careful with the 
                  eight months, but if the money is in the bank for eight months and 
                  the period for paying interest is two months then because 
                  <m>\frac{8}{2}=4</m> we know that the interest will be paid four 
                  times. That is, <m>n=4</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can also think it through chronologically, to help us develop
                  our intuition about money and its relationship to time in such
                  situations as this. With simple interest, the interest payment is
                  the same every time so we can simply compute what that payment is.
                  In this case, 4% of $600 is <m>(0.04)(600)=24</m>. So every two 
                  months, Marty gets $24 added to their account. This happens four 
                  times: after two months, after four months, after six months, 
                  and after eight months. So the total will be:
                  <me>
                    600+24+24+24+24=600+(4)(24)=600+96=696
                  </me>
                  All the formula has done is to somewhat automate this thinking
                  for us. It may not matter much in a case like this with only a
                  few interest payments, but if we were considering hourly interest
                  payments that were adding up over the course of decades, we might
                  be rather grateful to relinquish the payment-by-payment viewpoint.
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
              This all seems quite simple, and is. (It is called 
              <q>simple interest</q> after all.) Yet there remains a fine point
              we should notice. If, as we have described, the money is not removed
              from the bank, we have a strange situation. At the start, the bank
              was paying a percentage of the money placed there. But as time
              goes along that amount sitting in the bank has grown. Yet the bank
              keeps paying the same fixed payment, based only on the original amount 
              rather than the new larger amount that the customer could withdraw
              if they chose. We will leave aside the tricky question of what
              exactly is going on here. (Where did this money come from? Did a new
              stack of bills burst into existence somewhere deep in the bank's 
              vaults?) Let us just notice that the customer is now allowing the 
              bank access to more money than at the start. Yet the bank is still
              only paying that original amount of interest? The technical term 
              (beyond the scope of this course and text) for discussing this
              aspect of the behavior of the system is 
              <term>force of interest</term>. We would say that in the context
              described, there is a declining force of interest, which benefits
              the borrower (in this case the bank) and is not in favor of the 
              creditor (in this case the customer).
            </p>
            <p>
              The more common practice, then, for computing interest is the form
              that keeps the force of interest constant. That practice is called
              <term>compound interest</term>.
            </p>
          </subsection>
          <subsection xml:id="subsec-compound-interest">
            <title>Compound Interest</title>
            <p>
              We should use caution when discussing a situation
              involving two parties and in which one party has more 
              money than it 
              needs and the other party has less money than it needs. Still
              there is an idea of fairness lurking here, which is that
              if the amount of money the bank is holding has increased
              then the bank should be paying a larger amount of interest
              in return for control of that larger amount of money.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might already have an intuition about this. All that needs to
              be done is to change the starting point. The problem with the
              simple interest situation is that it is always looking back to
              the original amount of money. What should happen instead? The
              interest should be computed based on the current amount of money
              in the account! We just need to be updating our perspective.
            </p>
            <remark>
              <p>
                We might also conceptualize this as taking the money out and 
                re-depositing it at each period, thus updating the <m>P_0</m>
                in the simple interest formula each time. This is also another
                way to see how compound interest has a certain logic to it:
                why should the creditor have to show up, withdraw and then 
                re-deposit the money to avoid getting a lower and lower 
                monetary benefit? Rather, the process should update itself.
                This is what compound interest does.
              </p>
            </remark>
            <p>
              As before, there is a formula we might use. We present it
              in a few different forms to allow for different angles on
              understanding it intuitively. In this formula, <m>P_0</m> is 
              the initial amount deposited (or, equivalently, loaned), 
              <m>r</m> is the 
              per-period interest rate (the percent increase each time period),
              and <m>t</m> is the number of time periods that the money is
              left in the account (or, equivalently, no payments are made
              by the borrower).
              <men xml:id="eqn-compound-interest">
                P=P_0(1+r)^t
              </men>
              If we look at this formula, remember that an exponent is
              just instructing us to repeatedly multiply by some factor.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is easily demonstrated with an example. We will keep most
              details the same as before, only switching to compound interest 
              instead of simple interest.

              <solution>
                <p>
                  One way to think about this is step-by-step. The interest will
                  be paid four times.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        After two months, the new amount in the account is:
                        <me>
                          600 + 600(0.04)=600(1+0.04)=600+24=624
                        </me>
                        Notice that after one time period, the result is the
                        same as for simple interest, $624. This should have 
                        been your expectation!
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Four months into the process, the interest is paid again, 
                        but now on the <em>new</em> amount:
                        <me>
                          624+624(0.04)=624(1+0.04)
                        </me>
                        <me>
                          =624+24.96=648.96
                        </me>
                        This is not a very large change, but you can see that this
                        amount is different, slightly more, than what would be in
                        the account under simple interest.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        We can repeat this twice more for the six-month mark:
                        <me>
                          648.96+(648.96)(0.04)=648.96(1+0.04)
                        </me>
                        <me>
                          =648.96+25.9584=674.9184
                        </me>
                        And for the eight-month mark:
                        <me>
                          674.9184+(674.9184)(0.04)=674.9184(1+0.04)
                        </me>
                        <me>
                          =701.915136
                        </me>
                        Now you may notice a strange thing here: fractions of a cent.
                        If you were the bank customer and were to look at your 
                        account information at these times, you would see an amount
                        rounded to the nearest cent. This gives our final answer:
                        $701.92
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
              The intermediate steps in the solution given above are written 
              in a variety of ways precisely to give you intuition about the
              formula. Notice that at each stage, the previous amount of money
              is being multiplied by the factor <m>(1+0.04)=1.04</m>. This is
              precisely the number that increases the amount by 4% each time!
              This, in turn, explains the exponent and why that exponent should
              be 4. The interest was paid four times. The amount in the account
              was increased by 4% four times. Thus:
              <me>
                600(1+0.04)^4=600(1.04)^4=701.92
              </me>
              But see how much more compact that is than to step through the 
              process one interest-period at a time? In this example we can
              do it either way and it is not terribly different in effort,
              but what if we wanted to know how much money there would be
              in the account after 80 months? Or 120 months? 
              In each of those cases
              it would be frustrating and boring to go step by step through
              the process, yet to type in the formula <m>600(1.04)^{40}</m> or 
              <m>600(1.04)^{60}</m> is essentially the same amount of work
              as for the case of eight months.
            </p>
            <p>
              A relatively simple idea! But of course, nothing can be left
              quite so simple, especially not by bankers. This is the perfect 
              place for a great quote from the play by Bertolt Brecht,

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-apr-compound">
            <title>APR and Compound Interest</title>
            <p>
              What you will most often see, when interest rates are being
              reported for an account or loan, is an <q>APR</q>, which 
              stands for <term>annual percentage rate</term>. This number
              is tricky and often has a huge amount of fine print associated
              with it. Setting aside those considerations, we will focus on 
              understanding its use in practical  
              situations. The key to all of this is to understand that,
              despite the words that make up the name for this concept,
              <em>
                it does not tell you the annual percentage increase
                in the account if you left alone it for a year.
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              So, how to understand APR? The good news is that we need only
              make a small adjustment to the compound interest formula 
              above. Where that introduction
              of compound interest focused on the percent change over
              each period of interest payment, the APR imagines
              dividing that percentage by however many times per year
              that the interest is being paid.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be explicit: if a savings account is paying 4% APR 
              compounded monthly, then the per month interest rate is
              <m>\frac{0.04}{12}</m>. Any time we are talking about
              an actual percent change in the amount for some time
              period, we call that the <term>effective interest rate</term>
              for that time period. So a 4% APR compounded monthly (also 
              sometimes described as a 4% monthly APR or a 4% APR paid
              monthly) means that the monthly effective interest rate
              is that 4% divided by 12. We think of that 4% as being 
              divided by the number of times that interest is paid
              in that year. (Thus for a daily APR of 4% the effective 
              interest rate each day would be <m>\frac{0.04}{365}</m>.)
            </p>
            <p>
              But this all means we have to make not one but two adjustments
              to the compound interest formula. One adjustment is to the
              percent change piece: no longer will it be just the <q>rate</q>, 
              now it will be the APR (in decimal form) divided by the number
              of times per year that interest is paid. The second adjustment is
              to the exponent. Where in the previous version of the formula, we 
              defined <m>t</m> to be the number of periods for which interest
              was paid, that is, the number of compounding periods, we will
              now switch to thinking of <m>t</m> always being measured in years.
              Think of this as a shift called for by our switch to the APR
              viewpoint. (Remember, that <q>A</q> in APR stands for 
              <q>annual</q>.)
            </p>
            <p>
              So the new formula for compound interest will be as follows:
              If the APR is <m>r</m> 
              compounded <m>n</m> times per year for <m>t</m> years, and the
              initial amount invested is <m>P_0</m>, then the amount in the
              account after those <m>t</m> years will be:
              <men xml:id="eqn-apr-compound">
                P=P_0\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
              </men>
               As always, let us pause a moment to try to fill in the intuition
               about this formula. Why does it do what we claim it does? Remember
               that what we are trying to do is to allow the percent increase to
               be applied as many times as makes sense. If the interest amount
               is added <m>n</m> times per year and the money is left in the
               account for <m>t</m> years, then interest will be paid <m>nt</m>
               times. That means that whatever percent increase, per period,
               we want to apply must be applied <m>nt</m> times, and that is 
               precisely what the exponent accomplishes. As for that percent
               increase: each of the <m>n</m> times per year it is paid, that 
               percent is the APR <m>r</m>, in its decimal form, divided by
               the number of times per year the interest is paid. So the 
               owner of the account receives <m>\frac{r}{n}</m> interest 
               increases <m>n</m> times each year. So the factor to increase 
               that original deposit of <m>P_0</m> is the usual 
               <m>\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)</m>. 
               The exponent on this factor repeats the
               interest payments for the proper number of times.

              <solution>
                <p>
                  In a situation like this, we can lean on the formula.
                  The only trick is to make sure we have interpreted the
                  details of the problem correctly and translated those 
                  details into the proper values for each variable.
                  In this case:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        The amount deposited is not determined any differently
                        from previous interest formulas: since Gilberte
                        is depositing $500 we know that <m>P_0=500</m>. 
                        So far we have:
                        <me>
                          P=500\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
                        </me>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        The APR is 3% compounded monthly. This gives us 
                        two pieces of information. First, the rate <m>r=0.03</m>. 
                        Equally important, the monthly compounding tells us
                        that the interest will be paid 12 times per year, so
                        <m>n=12</m>. Thus we now have:
                        <me>
                          P=500\left(1+\frac{0.03}{12}\right)^{12t}
                        </me>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        Finally, we are told that Gilberte plans to leave
                        the money in the savings account for two years
                        without any additional deposits or withdrawals.
                        That means that the final variable, representing
                        time in years, should be <m>t=2</m>. Thus:
                        <me>
                          P=500\left(1+\frac{0.03}{12}\right)^{(12)(2)}=530.88
                        </me>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
              Before we move on, we should note one other fact about this 
              situation. Once the APR, compounding period, and initial 
              deposit have been set, the only variable that affects the balance 
              in the savings account is time, <m>t</m>. That means we could,
              as in <xref ref="ch-preliminaries"/>, define the current
              amount in the account as a function of that one variable. That is, 
              if, as in the example, we know that <m>P_0=500, r=0.03, n=12</m> 
              then we may write the function:
              <me>
                P=500\left(1+\frac{0.03}{12}\right)^{12t}=500(1.0025)^{12t}
              </me>
              <me>
                =500(1.0304159569135067)^t
              </me>
              The only thing we should be very careful about in such a situation is that 
              we should technically only trust this formula for values of <m>t</m> that
              (in this case) correspond to <m>\frac{1}{n}=\frac{1}{12}</m> of a year.
              That is: since this formula is designed to represent money in the account
              just after an interest payment has been added to the amount in the account,
              we should only use the formula for values of <m>t</m> that correspond to
              those sorts of moments. An easy way to see why this might be is to 
              think about using it for some value of <m>t</m> that corresponds to one 
              week after the most recent interest payment. Since this value of <m>t</m>
              would be larger than it was when that interest payment was made, the 
              amount in the account would, according to the formula, be larger too. But
              the amount in the account does not actually change until the next interest 
              payment, roughly three weeks after this. So the theoretical amount suggested
              by the formula only matches the true amount in the account at those moments 
              when an interest payment has just been added to the account. That is,
              only for those moments when <m>t</m> is something equally divisible
              by <m>\frac{1}{n}=\frac{1}{12}</m>.

                      Or you could use a spreadsheet program and build a table

                      there is some way to use algebra to find the value of the one
                      variable you do not know. (This requires the use of logarithms,

            <title>Annual Yield</title>
            <p>
              Despite APR being a (supposed) attempt at a clear
              numerical measure to be able to compare alternative
              savings or credit/loan opportunities, there remains
              some difficulty. 
              Since a savings account with 5% APR compounded monthly 
              will behave
              differently from a savings account 
              5% APR compounded quarterly (four
              times per year) it would be nice to have a measure
              that distinguishes between the two of them. In fact, 
              it can be even more tricky. For example, money
              grows faster in a account with an APR of 8%
              compounded daily than in an account with an APR
              of 8.05% compounded quarterly! (How would you
              convince yourself that this is true?)
            </p>        
            <p>
              One way to resolve this is, as is so often, to
              find a common perspective from which to view the
              situation. In this case, we will focus on the
              growth of money over the course of a year. That is,
              we will introduce the idea of 
              <term>annual yield</term>. Yield is, of course, a new 
              word for us in this context. Among other connotations
              it includes a hint of agricultural meaning. We can
              imagine the idea of sowing a certain amount of seed
              in a field and then checking, upon harvest, how much 
              more of the crop we have been able to produce. The 
              idea is no more complex than this: if some amount
              of money was placed into this account for a year,
              by what percent will it have increased?
            </p>
            <p>
              Equivalently: what annual effective interest rate would
              grow the money at the same (yearly) rate as the given
              APR? If we know the APR, <m>r</m>, the 
              number of times compounded per year for the APR, <m>n</m>,
              then we seek some annual effective interest rate, <m>i</m>, 
              which grows the money at an equivalent rate over the 
              course of one year.
              This immediately suggests the equation that we  
              should set up: the left side of the equation
              is the amount function for APR and the right side
              is the accumulation function for an annual effective
              interest rate:
              <me>
                P_0\left( 1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}=P_0(1+i)^t
              </me>
              But we can make this even easier to solve. We have
              already said we are seeking equivalence over the course
              of a single year, which means we set <m>t=1</m>. 
              Better still, since <m>P_0</m> is on each side of the 
              equation, it can be divided away! (This makes sense
              because we are only seeking the percent change
              over the course of the year, and the percent change 
              would be the same for a deposit of $1 as it would for
              a deposit of $1000 or $1,000,000.) Thus:
              <me>
                \left( 1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^n=1+i
              </me>
              And since we seek <m>i</m> and have been provided with
              <m>r</m> and <m>n</m>, we thus have a formula for
              <m>i</m> simply by subtracting 1 from each side of the 
              equation:
              <men xml:id="eqn-yield-from-apr">
                i=\left( 1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^n-1
              </men>
              As is often the case, we might also sometimes want to know
              what APR would realize some given yield. We can also answer
              this quickly, though it requires finding an <m>n</m>th 
              root. 
              <men xml:id="eqn-apr-from-yield">
                r=n\left((1+i)^{\frac{1}{n}}-1\right)
              </men>

          <title>Understanding Loans</title>
          <introduction>
            <p>
              We have spent quite some time on savings accounts and 
              using that context to understand interest in general. The hope
              is that we may now lean on the beginnings of your intuition
              about interest as we move into the more complex financial
              objects: loans.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will use the terms <term>borrower</term> and 
              <term>lender</term> throughout this section. The
              borrower receives an amount of cash in the present.
              They get money right now, in return for a promise
              that they will pay money back to the lender in the
              future. The repayment might take place all at once
              or might be accomplished by a series of payments,
              and these payments in turn might all be the same
              amount or they might change in amount over time.
              As long as we are careful about how we think about
              the agreement between the two parties, we will be
              able to understand how these payments can be in
              alignment with agreed-upon interest rates associated
              with the loan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loans are an almost inescapable fact of modern life 
              under capitalism. The granting or refusal to grant 
              loans is a sometimes brutal expression of power, with
              effects upon whether families can secure reliable housing.
              Historically, this tool has been wielded in biased ways.
              It is still wielded in biased ways. (We will discuss ideas
              around credit scores and risk analysis in
              <xref ref="ch-probability"/>.)
            </p>
            <p>
              The chances are good you and your family are already
              enmeshed in loan agreements, whether related to housing or 
              also possibly related to your payments for your education.
            </p>
          </introduction>
          
          <subsection xml:id="subsec-single-payment">
            <title>Single Payment Loans</title>
            <p>
              A loan is merely a financial agreement. Money is provided
              in the present by one party, the lender, and this money is
              given to the other party, the borrower. It is agreed between
              the two parties
              that the borrower will provide money at one or more times
              in the future. A loan is nothing more than this. We will
              bring in ideas of interest and even more complicated thinking
              but in the end a loan is only this: the borrower receives
              money now
              and will return money in the future. If you give your 
              friend $1000 and they say, 
              <q>
                I'll pay you back $1100 in a couple years,
              </q>
              then the two of you have agreed upon a loan. The 
              conditions described do <em>imply</em> an annual 
              interest rate for that loan (or even imply a monthly
              APR, if you wanted to think it through that way) but
              the two of you need not ever name or even think about
              the interest involved. You have agreed upon what each
              of you will do, so the situation
              is a loan. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When, as described, the loan consists only of two 
              payments, one in each direction, the situation is 
              essentially equivalent to the savings account
              examples we saw in <xref ref="sec-interest"/>.
              Remember, when one places money into a savings 
              account one is loaning money to the bank!
            </p>
            <remark>
              <p>
                Just think how much ideological effort has
                gone into getting us all to think about the
                bank as serving the customer when in fact
                it is receiving a loan from us. Once you 
                begin thinking carefully about these 
                processes it becomes impossible to ignore how
                much shaping of our thought has taken place 
                down through the years.                  
              </p>
            </remark>
            <p>
              Since it is the same situation, we need not build
              up any new apparatus to answer such a question.

                  Recall what we said about changing perspectives:
                  We are really asking how much Peleg will have in
                  a savings account after three years if he is
                  receiving a compound interest payment of 6% 
                  at the end of each year. The deposit is the
                  amount paid to Bildad, $200. The number of 
                  interest periods is three, since the interest is
                  charged each year. Thus, 
                  <m>r=0.06, P_0=200, t=2</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, using our formula in this new context we 
                  get:
                  <me>
                    P=P_0(1+r)^t=200(1+0.06)^3=238.20.
                  </me>
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
              A more usual situation for loans is that the single
              payment to the borrower in the present is balanced
              by multiple future payments. Let us begin to explore 
              these now.

            <title>Making Interest Payments Along the Way</title>
            <p>
              A somewhat unusual way to repay a loan is described 
              in this section. We will not explore it deeply, but
              it is included in the hope that understanding the
              logic of this approach to repayment will help
              ground future intuition about more complicated 
              repayment schemes.
            </p>
            <p>
              As always, remember that when
              we speak of <q>logic</q> in this context, we are 
              referring to analysis of a hoped-for (or purported?)
              internal coherence of the practices surrounding these 
              financial instruments, not endorsing the practices
              as natural or moral or efficient or good.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we think about Bildad and Peleg and their agreement
              in <xref ref="ex-single-payment-loan"/>, we can imagine 
              Peleg perhaps having second thoughts. As they sit across
              from each other, Peleg imagines that it might be nice 
              to receive some small amounts of money in the meantime
              so that he can take care of maintenance of his own
              around the boatyard or the house. They already have an
              agreement about the interest rate, no reason to
              reopen all of that negotiation. But Peleg might
              ask that Bildad pay the interest payments at the end of
              each year. How would this then play out?
            </p>
            <example xml:id="ex-interest-only-loan">
              <title>Interest-Only Payments on a Loan</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Bildad has borrowed $200 and agreed to pay the
                  6% annual interest at the end of each year as 
                  well as the
                  full amount at the end of the loan, after 
                  three years. What payments
                  are made by Bildad to Peleg and when does he make
                  them?
                </p>
              </statement>
              <answer>
                <p>
                  Bildad pays $12 after one year, $12 after two
                  years, and $212 after three years.
                </p>
              </answer>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  At 6% per year, Bildad will owe Peleg how much
                  at the end of the first year? We can use the usual
                  formula:
                  <me>
                    P=200(1+.06)^1=200(1.06)=200+12=212
                  </me>
                  Note the third step in our arithmetic: 
                  <m>200+12</m>.
                  Here we can see an important distinction: 
                  there is the original loan amount, $200, 
                  and the interest amount at that moment 
                  in time, $12. As we move deeper into examination
                  of loans, we will need to pay close attention
                  to this sort of distinction. The point is that
                  in this payment scheme, Bildad makes a payment
                  of $12 which reduces the amount he owes, at that
                  moment, to the original $200. The interest then
                  begins growing once more. We will often say that 
                  the interest <term>accrues</term>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Interestingly, we could think of the loan restarting
                  at this moment only now as a two-year loan at an annual
                  rate of 6%. After another year, once again Bildad
                  owes Peleg $212 and makes a payment of $12 to reduce
                  the <term>outstanding loan balance</term> to $200 once
                  more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The last year is slightly different, though not in
                  how the interest accrues. Once more the loan balance
                  grows from $200 to $212. Bildad now owes that full amount
                  since the agreement was that the loan would be fully
                  paid off after three years. It is still correct to think
                  of this payment as made up of $12 of interest and the 
                  remaining $200 as the original loan amount.
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
              Before we move on to yet another form of loan repayment,
              we should compare the two situations we have seen thus
              far, in <xref ref="ex-single-payment-loan"/> and in 
              <xref ref="ex-interest-only-loan"/>. 
              Specifically, let us 
              consider how much money Bildad paid to Peleg in total
              under each of these payment schemes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="ex-single-payment-loan"/> Bildad paid 
              $238.20 at the end of the process and no other payments.
              Bildad, thus, paid back $38.20 beyond the amount he
              received at the beginning of the process. But in the 
              second payment scheme, in 
              <xref ref="ex-interest-only-loan"/>, Bildad paid $12, 
              then $12 more, then $212. This is a total of $236 repaid
              to Peleg. How are we to make sense of this if, in each
              case, a 6% annual rate of interest was in effect?  
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps you have an intuition: if we take the lens on
              interest which views it
              as the price paid by the borrower for control of the
              money in question, then in this case Bildad, in the second
              case, returned control of some of the money earlier in
              the process. So since Peleg gains control of $12 after
              one year and another $12 after two years, then the total
              <q>price</q> to Bildad for use of the original $200 drops
              to a total of $36 rather than the $38.20 he had to pay 
              under the original scheme. We call this number the 
              <term>total interest</term> or 
              <term>total interest paid</term> and it is always the 
              difference found by summing all cash payments and then
              subtracting from that sum the original loan amount.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can also make sense of the difference
              between the two amounts of total interest in this case 
              by viewing through the lens of
              risk. By receiving some of the repayment money before the 
              end of the loan term, Peleg has slightly reduced risk. Think
              of it as a reduction in risk of total loss. Since this 
              payment scheme is slightly less risky for Peleg, Bildad 
              can pay slightly less overall for the chance to use the 
              loan money.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other thing that is made more clear by consideration
              of this scheme for repaying a loan is this: it might be 
              quite a challenge to have the cash on hand for the 
              large payment at the end of this process. It is helpful
              to have repaid some amount along the way to help reduce
              the final payment and reduce the total payment as well.
              But once we have begun to consider alternative ways to 
              repay a loan under the logic of interest that we have
              described here, it is worth considering just how 
              creative we might attempt to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, from the point of view of the borrower,
              why should the intermediate payments be so small that 
              they only cover the interest accrued? Perhaps it would
              make sense for Bildad to pay not just the $12, but 
              some extra amount to reduce the outstanding loan balance
              as well.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Suppose Bildad and Peleg change the 
                  loan agreement yet again.
                  The loan will still be for $200. 
                  The annual interest rate will remain 6%, as will the 
                  agreement that payments should happen at the end of the
                  first, second, and third years. Suppose Bildad suggests
                  that the payments at the end of the first and second 
                  years should be $40. Then what should the final payment
                  be and how much total interest will Bildad have paid? 
                </p>
              </statement>
              <answer>
                <p>
                  The final payment will be $150.86.
                </p>
              </answer>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  If Bildad paid $40 at the end of the first year,
                  then $12 of that would pay the interest that had accrued
                  while the other $28 would reduce the original loan 
                  amount. This would have the additional benefit that now,
                  as of that moment, Bildad would only owe Peleg $172, since
                  <m>200-28=172</m>. This, in turn, would mean that the 
                  6% annual rate would create a smaller amount of interest
                  when the end of the second year arrived. Bildad would
                  only owe <m>172(0.06)=10.32</m> dollars in interest at
                  the end of the second year, which, combined with the 
                  previous year<rsq/>s loan balance of $172 would mean
                  a total of $182.32. Another way to see this same 
                  perspective is: 
                  <me>
                    P=172(1+0.06)^1=172+10.32=182.32
                  </me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the second year, then,
                  when Bildad makes his payment of $40, 
                  the amount he owes will drop from $182.32
                  to $142.32. If we wish to think about how his
                  $40 payment was divided, $10.32 of it went to 
                  cover the new interest from that year, with the other
                  $29.68 coming off the (previous) balance of 
                  once the $172.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What happens to finish the process? Once again,
                  over the course of this last year, the loan balance
                  increases according to the 6% annual interest rate. 
                  So at the end of the process, after three years, 
                  the final amount owed will be 
                  <m>142.32(1.06)=150.8592</m> which rounds to the
                  nearest cent as $150.86. This is the amount of the
                  final payment to Peleg. $8.54 of this final payment
                  is for interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two ways to compute the total interest paid.
                  First, we can simply sum the total payments and subtract
                  the original loan amount. This us usually the easiest way
                  to find total interest paid. In this case, the total 
                  payments are <m>40+40+150.86=230.86</m>. Thus, the
                  total interest paid is <m>230.86-200=30.86</m> dollars.
                  Equivalently, since we have already gone to the trouble
                  of noting how much of each payment went to interest, we
                  could add up those portions attributable to interest along
                  the way. It should give us the same answer. And, indeed,
                  <m>12+10.32+8.54=30.86</m> does indeed give us the same 
                  amount of total interest. Notice also that this amount is
                  smaller than the amounts of total interest paid in
                  <xref ref="ex-single-payment-loan"/> and 
                  <xref ref="ex-interest-only-loan"/>. This should agree
                  with your intuition, since this sequence of payments 
                  returns still more of the loaned money to the control of 
                  Peleg earlier in the process, meaning Bildad can
                  logically pay a smaller total price 
                  (for reasons of risk reduction for Peleg
                  or for reasons of increased earlier control of cash for Peleg).

          <p>
            Before we move on to develop the approach to level-payment
            loan repayment schemes, we need to build up a little more
            theory around the interaction between money and time
            under the logic of some fixed interest rate.

        <section xml:id="sec-time-value">
          <title>The Time Value of Money</title>
          <p>
            Before we leave the topic of money and interest and the
            systems within which we are enmeshed, let us gather the
            ideas into a sort of coherent approach. The fact that the
            entire structure is formed by human habit and choice need
            not prevent us from thinking through how its logic can be
            extended into more ornate systems of payments. If we can 
            understand this, we can understand a whole variety of 
            financial tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            To keep things simple, throughout this section we will
            carry out our analysis in somewhat generic terms, where
            interest <m>i</m> is compounded per time period. The most
            common such periods would be year or month. Most of our 
            examples will be presented in terms of years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fundamental question that drives the entire logic of
            the following tools is this: How valuable is it, right now,
            to have the right to receive some fixed amount of money 
            at a fixed moment in the future? A more specific version
            of this question: how much should you pay, now, to receive 
            $100 in one year? 
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer depends on an interest rate! We seek a system,
            as we have discussed previously, that has a certain internal
            logic to it. This is not just some idealistic wish: in 
            a financial system that fails to fit together with this 
            sort of logic, there will be available certain no-risk 
            arrangements of payments with positive value, and this is
            viewed as
            a sort of inefficiency in the system. Such a no-risk way
            to make money is called an 
            <term>arbitrage opportunity</term> and they tend not to last
            long in the real financial/economic system. (There are whole 
            arrays of computers whose sole mission in life is to 
            spot such opportunities and automatically invest in them
            as swiftly and effectively as possible before they dissappear.)
            When we assume a certain interest rate, we can then discuss 
            the <term>present value</term> of some future cash flow or set
            of cash flows. We call this assumed interest rate the 
            <term>risk-free rate</term>. (Our analysis in this text 
            will only ever assume a single such rate. There is a whole
            fascinating world to explore once one allows for the more
            realistic situation of different rates available over 
            different amounts of time. But this is well beyond our
            set of concerns in this text.)
          </p>
          <p>
            So: if we assume that the risk-free interest rate is
            an annual effective interest rate of 5%, how 
            much should we pay right now to receive $100 in a year?
            The answer should look very familiar! This is the 
            same old question from earlier in this text, only 
            slightly disguised. We are asking how much should 
            be invested, right now, so that it will grow to $100
            at the end of the year. So using 
            <xref ref="eqn-apr-compound"/> 
            <me>
              P=P_0\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
            </me>
            with
            <m>r=0.05, n=1, t=1</m> and <m>P=100</m> we find:
            <me>
              100=P_0\left(1+\frac{0.05}{1}\right)^{(1)(1)}
            </me>
            This simplifies to:
            <me>
              100=P_0(1.05)
            </me>
            So we conclude that we should invest:
            <me>P_0=\dfrac{100}{1.05}=95.238095</me>
            which rounds to $95.24. But let us restate
            the key idea here:
            <em>
              The present value of a future cash payment is
              the amount that, if invested now at the risk-free
              rate, would grow under compound interest to
              equal that future cash payment at that future time.
            </em>
            So in this case the present value of $100 is $95.24, when 
            we assume a risk-free interest rate of 5% annual effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be clear: this rationale applies for all time intervals.
            So we can say that the value of a $100 payment in five years
            under 5% annual effective interest is:
            <me>
              PV=\dfrac{100}{(1+0.05)^5}=78.3526
            </me>
            Thus, the present value of $100 received in five years is
            $78.35 when 
            we assume a risk-free interest rate of 5% annual effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one more very helpful fact about present values: 
            because we are generating them from a coherent set of 
            assumptions, grounded in mathematics, we can combine them
            easily as well using arithmetic.

            The true power of this perspective on understanding
            the value of cash flows is this: we need not be limited
            by only the present value. In fact, by thinking of
            this logic carefully, we can shift our perspective, 
            as needed, to find the value of series of cash
            flows at <em>any</em> point in time. It is true that,
            for the topics treated here, we can resolve most of our
            questions in the present, using present value, which is
            the value of the cash flows at time <m>t=0</m>. But if 
            judging the value of a cash flow at a different point in
            time is nothing more than multiplying or dividing by
            the appropriate version of <m>(1+i)^n</m> then we have
            some true flexibility.

                      There are multiple ways for us to understand this. 
                      Perhaps the most useful for building intuition is this:
                      we can think about finding the present value (that is, 
                      the <m>t=0</m> value) of the payment, and then take that
                      present value and move it forward to the target time.
                      In other words we can think of selling the payment at
                      <m>t=5</m> right now, then taking that cash in the 
                      present and investing it at the risk-free rate for two
                      years until <m>t=2</m>. The present value of the payment
                      is:
                      <me>
                        PV=\dfrac{100}{(1+0.04)^5}=82.19
                      </me>
                      When this is then allowed to grow for two years at 4% annual
                      compound interest it grows to:
                      <me>
                        \left(\dfrac{100}{(1+0.04)^5}\right)(1+0.04)^2=\dfrac{100}{(1+0.04)^3}=88.90
                      </me>
                      We can also see that we get the same result by thinking
                      of the process as moving through time. The $100 at five
                      years, <m>t=5</m> must travel backwards by three years to
                      time <m>t=2</m>. To travel backwards, we divide by a power
                      of <m>(1+0.04)</m> and the appropriate power is given by
                      how many time periods we are traveling in the backwards 
                      direction. In this case, that is three years. Thus:
                      <me>
                        V_2=\dfrac{100}{(1+0.04)^3}=88.90
                      </me>
                      A final way to find this numerical value
                      is simply to insert the appropriate
                      values into the equation in
                      <xref ref="principle-time-value-of-money"/>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      This is perhaps a little more straightforward. Indeed,
                      this is a question we could have answered much
                      earlier in this chapter, simply by recognizing 
                      that this is $100 sitting in an account paying
                      4% compound interest for seven interest periods. We
                      somewhat naturally place ourselves at that moment
                      in time when the deposit is made. It is worth 
                      emphasizing, though, that this is what we are doing.
                      We need to feel more comfortable moving ourselves to
                      different temporal perspectives, specifically by
                      telling ourselves, we want to view this from <m>t=3</m>
                      or from <m>t=10</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So one solution is just to write:
                      <me>
                        V_3=100(1+0.04)^7=131.59
                      </me>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is worth continuing to build our intuition, though. One
                      other perspective that leads us to the same answer:
                      first, find the present value of $100 by moving it back
                      to the present, which is back three years, by dividing 
                      by <m>(1+i)^3</m>, then moving that present value
                      forward by ten years by multiplying by <m>(1+i)^10</m>. 
                      This results in the same numerical value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The final perspective, of course, is simply to insert the
                      appropriate values of <m>T_0, T_1, i</m>, and <m>C</m>
                      into <xref ref="principle-time-value-of-money"/>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The important principle here is that, as with present
                      value, we can take the individual <m>t=5</m> point of view
                      on each of these payments and simply add them together
                      at that moment in time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So the <m>t=5</m> value of the payment in three
                      years is <m>100(1+0.04)^2=108.16</m> while the <m>t=5</m>
                      value of the payment in ten years is 
                      <m>\frac{100}{(1+0.04)^5}=82.19</m> and when we add
                      those we get $190.35.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, another perspective would be to bring everything 
                      back to present value, like so:
                      <me>
                        PV=\frac{100}{(1+0.04)^3}+\frac{100}{(1+0.04)^{10}}
                      </me>
                      Then we project that present value forward by five years
                      by multiplying by <m>(1+0.04)^5</m> which gives us:
                      <me>
                        V_5=(1+0.04)^5\left(\frac{100}{(1+0.04)^3}+\frac{100}{(1+0.04)^{10}}\right)
                      </me>
                      which then simplifies to:
                      <me>
                        V_5=100(1+0.04)^2+\frac{100}{(1+0.04)^5}

          <p>
            Finally, because so many of our later applications
            involve a large number of equal cash payments 
            repeated at regular intervals, we will benefit from
            understanding one more formula. We wish to be able to
            easily compute the 
            present value of <m>n</m> future payments of  
            <m>Q</m> dollars. The payments are made at times
            <m>t=1, 2, \dots, n</m>.

            As so often, we will start with a simple example.

                Since we know that the present value of each payment
                can be found by dividing by some power of <m>(1+0.02)</m>
                and since we also know that we can simply sum up 
                these present values, the appropriate formula is:
                <me>
                  PV=\dfrac{200}{(1+0.02)}+\dfrac{200}{(1+0.02)^2}+\dfrac{200}{(1+0.02)^3}+\dfrac{200}{(1+0.02)^4}

          <p>
            This sort of calculation is not so bad when there are only a few
            payments. But what about a large, long-term loan? These can routinely
            have 360 or 480 payments. You presumably do not have the patience
            (nor should you!)
            to write out 360 or 480 terms in a sum. Luckily, algebra can save
            us quite a bit of work.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can make use of a fact from algebra (which relies
            upon some rather deep principles from calculus) to 
            make things quite a bit nicer for ourselves. Namely,
            that the following equation is true as long as 
            <m>r \ne 1</m>:
            <men xml:id="eqn-polynomial-division">
              1+r+r^2+\cdots+r^{n-1}=\dfrac{1-r^n}{1-r}
            </men>
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps you can see how this helps. We want to
            know the present value of <em>any</em> number
            of equal future payments made at consistent 
            intervals. What would the long version of that
            look like? It would look like this (with our 
            usual variables of <m>i</m> for per-period interest
            rate, <m>Q</m> for the dollar amount of each payment, 
            and <m>N</m> for the total number of payments):
            <me>
              PV=\dfrac{Q}{(1+i)}+\dfrac{Q}{(1+i)^2}+\cdots + \dfrac{Q}{(1+i)^N}
            </me>
            This might not look so promising. But notice that every
            term has a factor of <m>\frac{Q}{(1+i)}</m> and if we factor
            this out from each term we get:
            <me>
              PV=\dfrac{Q}{(1+i)}\left(1+\dfrac{1}{(1+i)}+\dfrac{1}{(1+i)^2}+\cdots + \dfrac{1}{(1+i)^{N-1}}\right)
            </me>
            Which is only a small step from:
            <me>
              PV=\dfrac{Q}{(1+i)}\left(1+\left(\dfrac{1}{(1+i)}\right)+\left(\dfrac{1}{(1+i)}\right)^2+\cdots + \left(\dfrac{1}{(1+i)}\right)^{N-1}\right)
            </me>
            That portion inside the parentheses now looks promising! 
            As long as <m>i \ne 0</m>, we can
            rewrite it using <xref ref="eqn-polynomial-division"/> with 
            <m>r=\frac{1}{(1+i)}</m> and <m>n=N</m> and we get:  
            <me>
              PV=\dfrac{Q}{(1+i)}\left(\dfrac{1-(\frac{1}{1+i})^N}{1-\frac{1}{(1+i)}}\right)
            </me>
            If we then distribute the denominator and simplify the numerator we get:
            <me>
              PV=\dfrac{Q\left(1-(\frac{1}{1+i})^N\right)}{(1+i)-1}
            </me>
            which then simplifies to:
            <me>
              PV=\dfrac{Q\left(1-(\frac{1}{1+i})^N \right)}{i}=\dfrac{Q}{i}\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1+i}\right)^N \right)
            </me>
            The most useful form of this formula is:
            <men xml:id="eqn-pv-many-future-payments">
              PV=\dfrac{Q \left((1+i)^N-1\right)}{i\left(1+i\right)^N}
            </men>
            We will build some quite useful future formulas
            from this relationship. It will be especially useful
            in our analysis of loans and their amortization.

                $251,353.49
              </p>
            </answer>
            <solution>
              <p>
                The first potential pitfall here is the interest rate.
                Since it is given to us as a monthly APR, we need to 
                transform it to a monthly effective interest rate. The 
                variable <m>i</m> in this formula must always be the 
                effective rate associated with the interval of time
                between payments. So, our effective rate can be found
                by <m>i=\frac{0.04}{12}</m>. Monthly payments for 30 years
                means <m>N=(12)(30)=360</m> total payments. Finally, 
                the payments are $1200 each, which means <m>Q=1200</m>.
                So when we plug all that into 
                <xref ref="eqn-pv-many-future-payments"/>, we get:
                <me>
                  PV=\dfrac{Q \left((1+i)^N-1\right)}{i\left(1+i\right)^N}=\dfrac{1200 \left((1+\frac{.04}{12})^{360}-1\right)}{(\frac{0.04}{12})\left(1+\frac{0.04}{12}\right)^{360}}
                </me>
                which means:
                <me>
                  PV=251{,}353.49
                </me>
                So the loan amount that Clarice has to use, now, in the present,
                is $251,353.49.
              </p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
            The formula allows us to understand the
            present value of large numbers of future payments, as long
            as the payments are equally spaced and the effective interest
            rate per period remains constant throughout the life of the 
            process. In fact, even if some payments are missed or if the 
            interest rate changes, we can, with some cleverness, still
            carry out this sort of analysis. But for now we are ready to
            move on to explore loans.

        <section xml:id="sec-amortized-loans">
          <title>Amortized Loans</title>
          <introduction>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="sec-loans"/> we learned about making
              interest payments in such a way that we could then
              make a final interest payment plus the originally
              loaned amount at the end of the process. This
              might be reasonable in some situations, but depending
              on the original loan amount, might be rather unreasonable.
              For example, if one were to use a loan to buy a house 
              for $700,000 (which is below the median sale price
              and below the median asking price in Seattle in 
              2025, according to Zillow) one would have to plan rather
              carefully to make sure one was able to make a payment of
              $700,000 (plus an interest payment!) 
              at the end of the loan period. Most people
              do not have this amount sitting around in their savings
              account. Further, such a large payment at the very end of
              the process makes the loan agreement more risky in the eyes
              of the granter of the loan. (What happens if the borrower
              refuses or cannot pay that extremely large last payment?)
            </p>
            <p>
              With this in mind, what is more usual is to spread out
              the intermittent payments so that they are all the same
              amount, or at least as close the same amount as is 
              possible. It turns out that the fact that all payments
              must be rounded to the nearest cent will have some effect
              on our quest for every payment to be exactly the same.
              (Why might this be?)

              We will balance two important goals for ourselves
              in this section. First, we wish to learn how to 
              construct a loan. That is, we will establish how to
              set up a series of future payments,
              from borrower to creditor, that will have
              equal present value to the loan amount that will be
              given to the borrower in the present. Simply: 
              borrower gets money now, what money does the borrower
              pay in the future? Naturally, this will depend upon 
              how many future payments there are, how frequently 
              those future payments will occur, and what  
              effective interest rate, per payment period, is 
              in effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              The number of ways a loan could be repayed is essentially
              infinite, dependent only upon how creatively the 
              borrower and creditor wish to be in agreeing to the 
              exchange of payments. Note, also, that these two
              parties need not even ever mention an interest rate. 
              They could agree to the payments and simply shake 
              hands and move on. (It is true that once those payments
              have been agreed to there is some implied interest
              rate (or, weirdly, possibly more than one!)
              that goes along with the loan, but these sorts
              of calculations, at least from scratch, are beyond 
              the scope of this text.)

                  We can see the interest rate must be 0% 
                  precisely because the amount she repays is
                  exactly equal to the loan amount. Notice that,
                  though we will often seek to keep the payments
                  all of equal size, even for a short-term loan 
                  like this, it will not always be possible. This
                  is because we must round to the nearest cent.

                    2000=Q\left(\frac{1}{(1+0.01)^1}+\frac{1}{(1+0.01)^2}+\frac{1}{(1+0.01)^3}+\frac{1}{(1+0.01)^4}\right)
                  </me>
                  Now we compute that number inside the parentheses (and you
                  will want to keep a lot of digits, generally, in such
                  cases) as 3.901965552. (This is the default number of digits
                  that a spreadsheet program and many calculators will return.)
                  <me>
                    2000=Q(3.901965552)
                  </me>
                  and thus:
                  <me>
                    Q=\frac{2000}{3.901965552}=512.5621878
                  </me>
                  So the level payment rounds to $512.56.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a slight complication here, though. When we 
                  check the present value of these payments, what happens?
                  <me>
                    PV=\frac{512.56}{(1+0.01)^1}+\frac{512.56}{(1+0.01)^2}+\frac{512.56}{(1+0.01)^3}+\frac{512.56}{(1+0.01)^4}
                  </me>
                  and thus:
                  <me>
                    PV=1999.9915
                  </me>
                  
                  This rounds to $1999.99. How do we correct for this? By
                  making an adjustment to the final payment. If we increase it
                  by a single cent we find:
                  <me>
                    PV=\frac{512.56}{(1+0.01)^1}+\frac{512.56}{(1+0.01)^2}+\frac{512.56}{(1+0.01)^3}+\frac{512.57}{(1+0.01)^4}
                  </me>
                  and thus:
                  <me>
                    PV=2000.0011
                  </me>
                  
                  Now the loan has been set up in such a way that it matches
                  the conditions set out at the start. The alternative 
                  payment scheme suggested above can be similiarly justified,
                  which is left to the reader.
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
              The unequal final payment, even on this loan with
              a limited number of payments, is an important thing to
              consider. It turns out that because the monetary system
              has the cent as its lowest denomination, every payment
              must be rounded to the nearest cent. This rounding,
              once it has occurred over some number of payments, 
              has a cumulative effect that must be accounted for.
              The most usual way to account for this is by making
              the final payment either larger, which is called
              a <term>balloon payment</term>, or smaller, which is 
              called a <term>drop payment</term>. You can probably 
              when each will occur. If the payments along the way were
              rounded down, then it is likely that a balloon payment
              will be needed. On the other hand, if they were
              rounded up along the way, a drop payment will suffice
              to fully retire the debt on the original loan amount 
              (which, remember, is also called the principal).
            </p>
            <p>
              The overarching principle remains consistent: we are
              seeking payments, as level as possible, that will
              have a present value that is equal, to the nearest 
              cent, to the original loan amount.
            </p>
            <p>
              The usual approach, in this case, is to find the level
              payment using the present value formula, which can be
              set up in a general way. (We solved it for this payment
              in <xref ref="ex-loan-with-four-payments"/> but we 
              can generalize what we did there.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <xref ref="eqn-pv-many-future-payments"/>
              <me>
                PV=\dfrac{Q \left((1+i)^N-1\right)}{i\left(1+i\right)^N}
              </me>
              can, in this context, be understood as an equation
              where the present value is the loan amount:
              <me>
                L=\dfrac{Q \left((1+i)^N-1\right)}{i\left(1+i\right)^N}
              </me>
              Now we may solve for <m>Q</m>, keeping in mind that because
              we will be rounding to the nearest cent, it will only
              tell us the correct payment for all but the last payment.
              (Remember, the last payment usually needs to be adjusted,
              up or down, 
              to allow the debt to be retired exactly with the last
              payment.)
            </p>
            <p>
              First we note that <m>Q</m> can be viewed as multiplied
              by the rest of the formula:
              <me>
                L=Q\dfrac{\left((1+i)^N-1\right)}{i\left(1+i\right)^N}
              </me>
              Then we can divide both sides by that large complicated
              fraction which leaves the level payment alone (once we also
              swap the sides of the equation for easier reading):
              <me>
                Q=\dfrac{L}{\frac{(1+i)^N-1}{i(1+i)^N}}
              </me>
              This can be simplified if one recalls algebraic rules about dividing
              by a fraction:
              <men xml:id="eqn-loan-level-payment">
                Q=\dfrac{L(i\left(1+i\right)^N)}{(1+i)^N-1}
              </men>
              Once the majority of the level payments have been 
              computed in this way, the final payment can be computed
              by making sure that the present value (that is, for 
              <m>t=0</m>) of all the payments, including the last 
              one, equals the original loan amount.

            <title>Outstanding Loan Balance During the Loan Term</title>
            <p>
              When we speak of the <term>amortization</term> of a
              loan, this refers to our ability to discern, throughout
              the process of repaying the loan, the current state
              of how much is owed, and, based on this, how each
              payment is split into one portion that covers the newly
              accrued interest and another portion that reduces the 
              original amount owed. In some ways, this might seem
              to be merely additional bookkeeping without much purpose.
              After all, once the two parties have agreed upon a 
              repayment scheme, what else is there to know?
            </p>
            <p>
              But of course, situations can change. What happens 
              if the buyers who are living in the house
              must move to another city? Then the house will often
              need to be sold. If the house is sold for $700,000 and
              the buyers used a loan to purchase the home for $600,000
              four years ago, what should happen? The buyers
              have been making payments and, in usual cases, those
              payments will have consistently exceeded what they
              owed in interest, so the original amount they owe to
              the bank should now be less than $600,000. But how much
              less? 
            </p>
            <p>
              In simplest terms, and leaving aside the 
              infamous <q>closing costs</q> (which can be accounted
              for later, once we have understood the basics) the original
              buyers, who are now selling the home for $700,000, will take
              some of that $700,000 to pay off their remaining debt
              to the bank. The rest, beyond that amount, they get to keep.
              Often they will need this money to put forward toward their
              next house, but the money is theirs to use how they see fit.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are left, then, with the question of how to determine
              how much of the house is owned by the bank and how much
              is owned by the buyers at any moment along the way.
              Well, perhaps not at <em>any</em> moment. We will focus on
              determining what the <term>outstanding loan balance</term>
              is in the instant just after a payment has been made.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two ways we can determine the current outstanding
              loan balance. Though one will usually be easier to 
              compute than the other, the ability to understand the 
              rational basis for each, within this overarching system of
              credit and debt, will help to solidify our intuition about
              the system. 
            </p>

                <p>
                  The outstanding loan balance (prospective version)
                  just after the <m>n</m>th payment 
                  is defined to be the <m>t=n</m>
                  present value
                  of the remaining payments, under the effective
                  per period interest rate of the original loan
                  agreement. Thus if the level payments are <m>Q</m>
                  dollars, the last payment is <m>R</m>, the total number
                  of payments is <m>N</m>, and 
                  the per-period interest rate is <m>i</m>, then the 
                  outstanding loan balance is:
                  <men xml:id="eqn-olb-prospective">
                    OLB_{pro}=\dfrac{Q \left((1+i)^{(N-n-1)}-1\right)}{i(1+i)^{(N-n-1)}}+\dfrac{R}{(1+i)^{(N-n)}}
                  </men>
                </p>
              </statement>
            </definition>
            <p>
              This is called the prospective version because it
              is <q>looking forward</q> at the future payments.
              Now, this could be quite a tedious computation, if not for
              the fact that we derived and understood 
              <xref ref="eqn-pv-many-future-payments"/>. Indeed, the 
              computation shown in <xref ref="ex-pv-many-future-payments"/>
              serves as an excellent first example of computing
              an outstanding loan balance in this way. After all, the
              original loan amount, or principal, is also always the
              first outstanding loan balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              But perhaps you have already noticed a slight problem here.
              The formula we use for the present value of a large number
              of future payments relies upon all of those payments being
              exactly equal. Yet we have seen that even in relatively 
              short-term loans, we quickly arrive at a situation where
              the final payment has to be adjusted up or down to fully
              retire the debt. There are ways to adjust for this, but
              they can be somewhat algebraically and conceptually complex.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can avoid this complexity by using the retrospective
              (that is, <q>looking backwards</q>) version of outstanding
              loan balance.
            </p>
            <definition xml:id="def-olb-retrospective">
              <statement>
                <p>
                  The outstanding loan balance (retrospective version)
                  just after the <m>n</m>th payment,
                  can be found by computing 
                  the <m>t=0</m>
                  present value of all payments made so far,
                  subtracting this present value 
                  from the original loan amount,
                  and then computing the <m>t=n</m> value of 
                  this difference under the effective
                  per period interest rate of the original loan
                  agreement. Thus if the payments are <m>Q</m>
                  dollars, the per-period interest rate is <m>i</m>,
                  and the original loan amount is <m>L</m> then the 
                  outstanding loan balance is:
                  <men xml:id="eqn-olb-retro">
                    OLB_{retro}=(1+i)^n\left(L - \dfrac{Q \left((1+i)^n-1\right)}{i(1+i)^n}\right)
                  </men>

            </p>
            <p>
              One last way of thinking of the retrospective
              version of the outstanding loan balance is as follows. This
              way of computing gives an equivalent amount as the one
              given in <xref ref="def-olb-retrospective"/> but some may
              find this way of thinking of the computation as more intuitive.
              The intuition here is the following:
              Take the original loan amount, think about how it would
              have grown, absent any payments, in the time so far.
              <me>
                L(1+i)^n
              </me>
              This is the amount that would be owed at time <m>t=N</m>
              if no payments had been made. But they have been made! 
              So how do we give credit for those payments? We find
              their present value at <m>t=0</m> using our standard
              present value formula, 
              <xref ref="eqn-pv-many-future-payments"/>, and then we
              move this forward in time to <m>t=N</m>. This number can 
              then be subtracted from the moved-forward value of 
              the original loan
              amount. 
              <me>
                OLB_{retro}=L(1+i)^n - \left(\dfrac{Q \left((1+i)^n-1\right)}{i\left(1+i\right)^n}\right)(1+i)^n
              </me>  
            </p>
            <p>
              Once this perspective has been unlocked, this ability
              to say, coherently, in touch with all the particulars
              of the financial agreement, how much is owed at
              any point in the process, we can answer
              all sorts of other questions. We can, for example, 
              determine just how much of each payment is going
              towards interest and how much towards the principal.
              This can be interesting from a bookkeeping perspective
              and does, in the USA, sometimes have tax implications.
              But our primary interest in being able to find the 
              outstanding loan balance was to be able to asnwer
              questions about how to adjudicate questions of who
              owns how much of the asset in the in-between time
              when the loan is not fully paid off.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will explore these questions in the next section.

            <title>How and Why to Refinance a Loan</title>
            <p>
              We will approach the final question around 
              loans with a two-stage approach. First, we will
              establish how to make sense of a situation where
              the underlying asset (usually a house) is sold while
              the loan is still being paid off. The reason, again,
              why this can be a somewhat complicated situation is
              that at this moment part of the house belongs to the
              person paying off the loan and part of the house 
              belongs to the bank. (We are leaving aside a detailed
              analysis of the underlying legal framework to keep
              the discussion of the financial aspect as clear as
              possible.) 
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that understanding this situation 
              only relies upon careful deployment of the ideas we 
              have already developed. So let us begin with an
              example:
            </p>
            <example xml:id="ex-sell-house">
              <title>Selling a House During the Loan Term</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Amanda and Naomi bought their home over nine years ago
                  using a 30-year $400,000 loan from Fedal Credit Union.
                  The APR for their loan is 5% compounded monthly. They are 
                  making monthly payments of $2,147.29. Their final
                  payment will be $2,144.37.
                  If they sell the house for $500,000 just after their 111th
                  payment, how much of that money must they pay to the bank
                  to pay off their loan and how much are they left with?
                  (There are various legal and processing fees usually
                  called <q>closing costs</q> but we will ignore them for
                  now.)
                </p>
              </statement>
              <answer>
                <p>
                 They must pay $332,345.85 to the bank and have $167,654.15
                 remaining afterwards.
                </p>
              </answer>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  The whole question hinges on how much of the loan
                  remains to be paid, that is, on the outstanding 
                  loan balance just after the 111th payment. We can 
                  compute that using either 
                  <xref ref="eqn-olb-prospective"/> or
                  <xref ref="eqn-olb-retro"/>. From the description
                  of the loan in the problem we know that there will
                  be <m>N=12(30)=360</m> total payments. The payment
                  amounts will usually be <m>Q=2147.29</m> and the last
                  payment will be <m>R=2144.37</m>. The original loan
                  amount is <m>L=400{,}000</m>. Finally, the per-interval
                  effective interest rate is <m>i=\frac{0.05}{12}</m> and
                  we know we are looking for the outstanding loan balance
                  just after the 111th payment, so <m>n=111</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once those values are provided to either of the 
                  outstanding loan balance formulas we find that that 
                  balance is $332,345.85.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From here, the last step is simple. They have just received
                  $500,000 and they owe $332,345.85. To find what is left over
                  we need only subtract:
                  <me>
                    500000-332345.85=167654.15
                  </me>
                  So Amanda and Naomi have $167,654.15 available to them,
                  either to put towards their next home or to use for other
                  purposes.
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
              Now that we have a rationale for how to understand
              a current state of affairs partway through a loan
              payment process, we are prepared to understand one
              last key process. Once more, we will discuss this 
              in the specific context of a home loan, but the 
              principles would apply without adjustment to
              other loans.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have restricted our exploration of financial
              matters using the somewhat artificial assumption
              of a relatively static financial reality. In fact,
              there are many financial institutions, offering many
              different sorts of loans or lines of credit. Conditions
              change over time as well, each economic forecast 
              altering the financial landscape, nudging interest
              rates up or down.
            </p>
            <p>
              And when interest rates decrease? That may provide
              an opportunity for someone currently paying off a loan.
              If you are paying off a loan with an APR of 5% monthly
              and find yourself with a chance to borrow money for 
              4% monthly, there is a chance you can reduce your payments
              or decrease the number of future payments and pay 
              off your loan early. How? By taking out a new loan at the
              lower rate. (Because of the previously mentioned closing
              costs for a loan, it will not be quite so simple as merely
              comparing the rates. This is why we say there is a chance
              rather than a certainty of a benefit.)
            </p>
            <p>
              This all relies upon the work we did in developing 
              our understanding of the outstanding loan balance
              partway through the process of paying off an 
              amortized loan. Because we can say how much debt 
              remains at any intermediate point along the way
              of the repayment process, the debtor can be looking
              around for other loans that might be used to pay
              off that debt in an advantageous way.
            </p>
            <p>
              But let us explore this by way of a couple examples.
            </p>
            <example>
              <title>Refinancing with a Lower Interest Rate: Lowering Payments</title>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Carlos, Jan, and Felix bought a house 11
                  years ago, and their 40-year loan with
                  monthly payments was for $500,000. They 
                  found a rate of 6% compounded monthly. The
                  level payments are $2751.07 with a final 
                  drop payment of $2747.49. The Rosethorn
                  Credit Union is offering a monthly APR
                  of 4.5% on montly-payment loans with term 
                  length 30 years or less. The friends wish
                  to refinance their loan by paying off their 
                  current loan balance with a new loan at Rosethorn.
                  The new loan will be a 29-year loan to cover the exact
                  outstanding loan balance just after the 132nd payment.
                  What is the loan amount (that is, the outstanding loan
                  balance) for the new loan and what will the new
                  monthly payments be? (Challenge: what would be the
                  drop or balloon payment at the end of the new loan?)
                </p>
              </statement>
              <answer>
                <p>
                  The outstanding loan balance is $453,219.98, which is also
                  the principal for the new loan. The level payments will be
                  $2334.05 (with a final balloon payment of $2335.92).
                  They reduced their monthly payments by over $400.
                </p>
              </answer>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  To find the outstanding loan balance after the 132nd 
                  payment we can, in this case, use either 
                  <xref ref="eqn-olb-prospective"/> or
                  <xref ref="eqn-olb-retro"/> since we have been
                  told the amount of the final payment. (If we only
                  knew the level payments we would have to use
                  the retrospective approach.) By using the variable
                  values <m>i=\frac{0.06}{12}, N=12(40)=480, L=500000, Q=2751.07</m>, 
                  and <m>n=132</m> we can compute the balance using 
                  <xref ref="eqn-olb-retro"/>. If we use all of those, plus 
                  <m>R=2747.49</m>, we can compute the balance using 
                  <xref ref="eqn-olb-prospective"/>: $453,219.98.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This will be our new loan amount. As we begin seeking
                  our new level payments, we use 
                  <xref ref="eqn-loan-level-payment"/>
                  with the new rate, term, and loan amount: 
                  <m>i=\frac{0.045}{12}, N=12(29)=348, L=453219.98</m>.
                  This will provide the new monthly payment of $2334.05.
                  The final payment can be found as the amount
                  that will make the present value of it and all the
                  other payments equal to the new loan amount.
                  We can use <xref ref="eqn-pv-many-future-payments"/>
                  to find the present value of all but the last 
                  payment. That final payment, which we can call 
                  <m>R</m>, must be valued all the way back at the
                  beginning of this new loan, and for this sort of
                  backward movement through time remember that we
                  divide by powers of <m>(1+i)</m>. So for us, in 
                  this case, the present value of the final payment
                  is:
                  <me>
                    \dfrac{R}{(1+i)^N}=\dfrac{R}{(1+\frac{0.045}{12})^{348}}
                  </me>
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>
            <p>
              The previous example shows the most common use of 
              refinancing a loan. But there are other reasons one 
              might wish to refinance: gaining more money in the
              present, for example to have money to make home 
              improvements, or to shorten the term for paying off
              all of the debt.

        <title>How Likely is Some Occurrence?</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            Now that we are becoming more comfortable with percentages 
            and proportions, why not think about a
            proportion of the time that something happens? It isn't 
            that different, conceptually, to say that 65%
            of some group of 100 people have brown eyes as it is to 
            say that 65% of the 100 days from February 14
            to May 25 have some rain that falls on Seattle at some 
            point during that day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trick as we begin wading into these waters is to 
            do so with a bit of a sense of wonder and play. Some of
            the early examples will feel almost trivial, often 
            descriptions of frivolous games of various sorts. The
            beauty of this is, though, that the principles and 
            practices we learn in these simple contexts can scale
            up to give us insight on rather complex and surprising
            applications later. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With this in mind, perhaps it is easier to suspend  
            impatience or eye-rolling impulses. Try, if you can,
            to just enjoy the game-like explorations near the start.
            But before we do that, a brief historical perspective.

            Let us begin with a fairly simple situation and try to 
            understand how our intuition might (possibly) rightly 
            direct us. Suppose five friends want to decide who
            should pick the next book for their book club. Because
            they are all too polite to insist, Ali suggests they put
            their names on five identical slips of paper, put those
            slips of paper into a container. We will imagine that
            container as a 
            metal urn out of a gentle respect for mathematical 
            tradition. Ben, Cal, Dani, Eve all agree to this system.
            In part this is based on their shared intuition that
            each of them are equally likely to be chosen by this
            method. This is an important assumption, and is one that
            we would do well to keep in mind for future situations 
            as well.

        <title>Marx and his Mathematical Models</title>
        <p>
          The brilliant philosophical and economic thinker, Karl Marx, 
          is one of the most influential 
          minds over the last two centuries, especially in our 
          understanding of the current dominant world
          economic system, capitalism. While it is beyond the 
          scope of this textbook to debate whether Marx
          was right or not (in itself a strange debate, generally 
          driven by ideology rather than honest desire
          for truth) instead we will focus on Marx's clever 
          deployment of mathematical models to help drive
          insight for himself and understanding for others. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Marx was faced with a problem: he saw the dynamic creative potential 
          within capitalism, yet he also clearly saw
          (in a way that far too many self-interested capital boosters now do not) 
          the enormous violence 
          this economic system visited upon those who performed the vast 
          majority of the hazardous and back-breaking
          labor within it. In the face of many theorists before and since, 
          Marx sought a mode of analysis that would
          not only explain the movement of capital and the deployment 
          of labor power, but also might generate
          insights about instability within the system and long-term tendencies. 
          All of this, he is carrying out very 
          near the birth of capitalism and in the context of its early 
          working out of its principles and practices.

          <title>A Dizzyingly Complex World</title>
          <p>
            A beautiful reality is that we inhabit a 
            universe that is boundlessly complex,
            filled with processes and orders that we 
            have only barely begun to understand. 
            One cannot get very far into the scientific 
            world without hearing a lot about
            statistics, and so we will begin to explore 
            them here.   
          </p>
          <p>
            The key idea for statistics is this: given that our ways of measuring reality
            are many, and given that many groups of objects or phenomena that we might 
            wish to measure and understand are quite numerous, how can we grasp patterns
            or tendencies within these groups? As humans, we have a very limited ability
            to recognize patterns or tendencies from within a huge list of numbers. We 
            simply did not evolve to have intuition for that sort of thing. The field we 
            call <q>statistics</q> is designed precisely to give us methods of summarizing
            and understanding tendencies within groups of objects.

            <p> 
              Suppose we wished to understand a certain variety of penguin inhabiting
              southerly islands at some point in time. We might wish to undestand the size
              of the adult penguins. Now, size might be measured in a variety of ways: length,
              mass, circumference of head, circumference of torso.

            We begin with a very simple sort of idea, one that 
            you have probably seen before. It is the idea of 
            proportions or percentages.

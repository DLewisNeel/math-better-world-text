        <title>Introduction: What is this for?</title>
        <p>
          The goal for this textbook is that it be different.
          Though many familiar topics will be explored, the person thinking along with this book
          will, with luck and commitment, work their way towards a different view of the world
          as it now exists. Ideally, the person thinking along with this book will find themselves
          committed to radical restructuring of the existing world order, which, in the opinion of this
          book<rsq/>s author, is monstrously wasteful of human potential, ecocidal towards human and
          nonhuman life, disruptive of unique and fascinating natural processes, stiflingly unfree and 
          cramped in its practices and beliefs.        
          Mathematics and its associated fields (statistics, data science, computer science,
          and so on) are often used to describe or predict the world. This is no longer enough. 
          The point is to change the world. The hope, and the wager, is that an approach to 
          some basic and fundamental mathematical ideas can equip and energize the reader, that is, you, 
          for that beautiful, important, and ennobling task.

          The French thinker Jacques Ranciere wrote a fascinating book,
          <pubtitle>The Ignorant Schoolmaster</pubtitle> about the
          French educator Joseph Jacotot. To radically oversimplify the point:
          Jacotot believed that all humans are equally intelligent and that
          explanation and lecture could often serve the purpose of 
          <q>stultifying</q>. That is, there is real cost in striving to skip
          past the struggle to understand by way of an explanation from a
          so-called authority in the subject. A powerful and challenging thought!
          Though this author will not now cease writing, and thus will be in

        <title>Percentages and Proportionality</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            We will open with a consideration of fractions, proportions, and percentages.
            These ideas are deeply interrelated and, what is more, incredibly tied
            to a lot of intuitive ideas about fairness.
          </p>
        </introduction>
        <section xml:id="sec-proportion">
          <title>Proportion</title>
          
            <p>
              We begin with a very simple sort of idea, one that you have probably seen before. 
              It is the idea of proportion or fraction. In what we might optimistically
              interpret as a hopeful sign, this concept is often introduced using the idea 
              of fair division of resources. If there are four bottles of water and four
              thirsty people, then we might easily decide that each thirsty person should
              get one bottle of water. That is, we divide the four bottles four ways, which 
              allows one bottle in each group. We indicate this by 
              <me>
                4 \div 4 = 1  
              </me>
              or
              <me>
                \dfrac{4}{4} = 1
              </me>.
              If we have eight bottles of water and four thirsty people, then:
              <me>
                \dfrac{8}{4}=2
              </me>
              and we conclude that we can give each person two bottles of water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this rests on an assumption that each person has equal need 
              for water. This assumption is extremely time- and situation-dependent.
              If one of the people has just been rescued from the desert or one of 
              the people is a child, we may need to adjust our use of mathematics.
              This may seem very obvious, yet many of our analyses of real-life 
              situations will show how often this assumption is ignored or abused, 
              usually when it favors the rich and/or powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
              This idea is easily extended beyond whole numbers into fractions, 
              though it is possible you have not thought about this aspect of fractions
              for some time. (Much of this text will be seeking to render visible 
              the assumptions and initial intuitive notions that may have been 
              introduced to you so long ago that you have forgotten why they are 
              intuitive.) But if we have six cookies and 12 children (all of whom 
              can safely eat all the ingredients in the cookies) we can, once more,
              use division to determine how many cookies each child may have. It 
              should be evident that there aren't enough cookies even for each 
              child to have a whole one to themselves.
              <me>
                \dfrac{6}{12}=0.5
              </me>
              This tells us that each child can have 0.5 of a cookie, which we tend to 
              call half a cookie, or <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> a cookie. You probably 
              understand the concept of <q>half</q>.
              But what if two of the children suddenly announce that they do not like
              this sort of cookie and would prefer not to have any. Now we have ten children
              and six cookies, which yields the situation:
              <me>
                \dfrac{6}{10}=0.6
              </me>
              This tells us that each child gets 0.6 of a cookie. What does this mean?
              We know it is less than a cookie and more than half a cookie. But how
              do we say anything more carefully and more explicit than this?
            </p>
            <p>
              If you found yourself saying, <q>That means 60% of a cookie,</q> then 
              congratulations. You just introduced us to the topic of the next section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we move on, we can recognize here the first instance of
              an important pattern. Many mathematical learners find themselves 
              impatient with memorization and formulas. This is quite understandable,
              especially when these have been used in place of building intuition 
              about why something works, why something does what we claim that it 
              does. This reflects our commitment to <xref ref="axiom-intuitive-math"/>. 
              In this case, the pattern to notice is that the number in the numerator
              (the top of the fraction) represents the number of objects we are 
              intending to share, while the denominator is the number of people we are 
              intending to share the objects amongst.
              <men>
                \dfrac{\text{# of objects to distribute}}
                {\text{# of objects that will receive what we distribute}}
              </men>
              We will, many times, find ourselves creating a template like this forming
              a simple fraction which will, nevertheless, provide us with powerful tools
              for supplementing our human intuition.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, we have a technical name for the description of a 
              process that allows us to compute
              or understand some situation: <term>algorithm</term>. This name is one of
              many that derive from Arabic or Islamic sources, a creative and
              vibrant piece of mathematical
              history that was ignored or de-emphasized by
              so-called <q>Western</q> historians and mathematicians
              for far too long. You can find out
              more in Berggren's <pubtitle>Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam</pubtitle>. 
              The word <q>algorithm</q> itself comes from the
              name of the Islamic mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, about whom you can read
              from the venerable St Andrews site on the history of math.

          <title>Percent</title>
            <p>
              Once we have the idea of a fraction, there is a benefit to introducing
              a sort of general format for a fraction. This is what a percent is. 
              It is even right there in the name, <em>percent</em>, from Latin. 
              The English language is filled with all sorts of fragments from other
              languages. Think of how you have heard <q>per</q> used. 60 miles per hour.
              45,000 dollars per year. 2000 calories per day. One dollar per taco.
              In each case, we are being
              informed of a certain amount of things for each of another object.
              So what does <q>cent</q> stand for then? If you think of the word 
              century, which is 100 years, maybe you will realize it stands for 100.
              So if we say <q>60 percent</q> we are really saying, <q>60 for each
              100</q>. So if we say, <q>60 percent of those children over there
              would like to eat
              some candy,</q> what we are actually expressing is that <q>if there 
              were 100 children like those children over there, then 60 of them
              would like to eat some candy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you see how this is a sort of standardized form of a fraction?
              We could say <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> or a quarter, but if we want a percent?
              We would say <q>25 percent.</q> Note also that we have a familiar
              notation for percent, which looks like this: %. So we could also just
              write: 25%. 
            </p>
            <subsection xml:id="subsec-general-fact">
              <title>A Useful General Fact about Percents and Proportions</title>
              <p>
                None of this would probably be worth learning, if not for what follows.
                Let us think about the situation with 12 children and six cookies.
                What if one of those children goes home and realizes that they would
                like to share their portion of a cookie, which we can recall was
                half a cookie, with their two other siblings. But then how much cookie
                does each sibling receive, if we assume that all three of them get
                the same amount? We are now dividing half the cookie into three equal
                pieces. If we think from the start of the process we can see:
                <me>
                  \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)}{3}=\dfrac{1}{6} \approx 0.167.
                </me>
                Note that this means we could say that each child gets approximately
                16.7% of a cookie. Or one-sixth of a cookie. Perhaps you recall that the 
                process above can also be accomplished by multiplication:
                <me>
                  \left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)\times\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)
                  =\dfrac{6}{36}=\dfrac{1}{6}\approx 0.167=16.7\%
                </me>
                We can think of this as first dividing the six cookies into 12 pieces,
                then dividing one of those smaller pieces into three equal pieces.
                This process is carried out by successive applications of taking some
                percentage.
              </p>
              <p>
                But let us emphasize this point: We may learn what percent of a cookie
                we are left with if we start with 50% of a cookie and then take 33% of it
                by multiplying the two decimal forms of these percents:
                <me>
                  (0.50)\times(0.3\overline{3})=0.16\overline{6}
                </me>
                Note that we should always be careful when moving from fractions to 
                decimal approximations of numbers or percentages. (This is a nice
                example of how moving between modes of implementation can sometimes
                mislead us.)

              Regardless of how deeply unjust and violent the current state 
              of the USA might be, and has arguably
              always been, at its founding it was based in certain principles, 
              including which was an idea about
              proportionality in decision making. In particular, an idea that 
              if states were to be represented in a legislative body, then
              those states should (sometimes) have that representation
              scaled by the population of that state. From the start, this 
              was a contested idea for many reasons, both because there 
              was no agreement on who counted as part of population and 
              related questions of how to handle the enslaved population. 
              If enslaved persons were counted as part of the population
              even though they had no practical voice in decision-making, then
              those who enslaved them would be granted extra power within
              the decision-making bodies of the young nation. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea of a representative legislative body itself offers a 
              good lens on the idea of democracy itself. If we have a state with
              100,000 people, we could make decisions by allowing each person to
              vote directly on every decision. You can see that this might be
              rather unwieldy in practice, but there would be, in a sense,
              no distortion at all. Every person is directly represented in
              the decision-making process; each person represents themself. 
              At the other extreme, we could select (by vote or by lottery) 
              one person to make the decisions for all 100,000 people. This
              allows the one person to swiftly make decisions, but we might 
              be disturbed that this person is now a dictator, at least until
              a new person is selected. So all representative bodies in between 
              are aimed at greater efficiency than everyone voting directly and
              more nuance and less total control than the one-person-in-charge
              version. But how do we do this in a fair and reasonable way?

              descriptions of the four methods at the US

              Suppose you have four states<mdash/>Mardi, Omoo, Pierre, 
              Redburn<mdash/>who wish to form a representative 
              legislative body with the number of representatives proportional
              to the states' populations. The populations are 30,000 in Mardi,
              40,000 in Omoo, 
              50,000 in Pierre, 
              and 70,000 in Redburn. The legislative body is to have 101
              representatives. (Perhaps the odd number was chosen 
              to avoid ties.) How would
              you suggest that this country go about doing this?
            </p>
            <p>
              A reasonable way to start is to consider proportions. Keep in mind
              the ways we have attempted to think about fairness previously. 
              What would it mean to match proportions in this case? We 
              need to recognize what proportion of population each state has.
              For that we also need total population and then we can use the 
              pattern or template we noted above.

              Let us put it another way: we want to distribute 101 cookies to 190,000
              people. In this view, we are trying to understand how much of a
              representative does each person get representing them in the

                  If we find this number, what would be the
                  next logical step for finding how many representatives each
                  state should have in the legislature?

                  If we have determined how much of a <q>cookie</q> each person
                  gets, then we can just see how many people are in a state and
                  add up all the (parts of) cookies that should be in that state.
                  That is, if we have determined how much of a <q>representative</q> 
                  each person is represented by,

            <title>The Hamilton and Jefferson Methods of Apportionment</title>
            <p>
              Two early methods are labeled by names that will be familiar to you
              if you have brought into yourself historical knowledge of the forming
              of the United States of America. Let us begin with the <em>Hamilton Method</em>.
            </p>
            <subsection xml:id="subsec-hamilton">
              <title>The Hamilton Method</title>
              <p>
                The challenge for the so-called <q>Founding Fathers</q> was that in 
                most situations where the population of states was different from each 
                other, and with most numbers of representatives in the legislative body,
                there would be the need to determine how to round off answers. Hamilton
                suggested the following approach:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Find the number of people each representative should represent,
                      if only the division could be accomplished perfectly.
                      We call this the <term>divisor</term>. How should it be computed? 
                      Take the full population and divide it by the number of representatives
                      in the legislature. So, 
                      <m>
                        d=\frac{\text{total population}}{\text{number of legislators}}
                      </m>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Now take each state<rsq/>s population and divide it by the divisor,
                      keeping only the whole number part which we call the
                      <term>initial quota</term>. Note that each state must 
                      be given at least one representative, even if the number computed 
                      above is smaller than 1.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If the sum of these initial quotas is equal to the size of the
                      legislature, then we have determined the proper representation for
                      each state. If it is fewer representatives than the total (this is
                      the most common occurrence) then you look at the decimal portion
                      from each initial quota and award another representative 
                      to the state with largest decimal part. Continue awarding 
                      additional representatives to the next largest decimal part
                      until the total number of representatives is equal to the
                      size of the legislature. This is the <term>final quota</term>
                      for each state.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <example>
                <p>
                  It is often important to think about what limitations there might
                  be on how an algorithm might function. In this case, the insistence
                  (which seems relatively innocent) that every state receive at least one
                  representative could potentially cause a breakdown. Consider a seven-state 
                  country with one state with 30,000 people and the other six states all
                  the same size of 500 people. If we had a 30-representative legislature, 
                  then the algorithm above would give 27 representatives to the large state
                  and one representative each to the other six states, for a total of 33
                  representatives. But this is too many for the legislature! This
                  requires a sort of addendum to the process, of the sort we generally like
                  to avoid in algorithms like this. We could just say, well, the large state
                  only gets 24 and that fixes the problem, but might this also happen with
                  two large states and 12 small states? Then where do the spare representatives
                  come from? And if the two large states aren't quite the same size? You can 
                  see how quickly things become complicated. Consideration of these <q>edge</q> or
                  <q>extreme</q> cases is important in any exploration of the mathematical
                  behavior of such systems.

            <subsection xml:id="subsec-jefferson">
              <title>The Jefferson Method</title>
              <p>
                The enslaver Thomas Jefferson, who systematically sexually assaulted 
                some of the people he enslaved, objected to the Hamilton Method. This was
                perhaps partially based on the fact that
                the apportionment that it produced violated a specific numerical insistence
                in the Constitution, that no representative should represent more than 30,000
                people. We shall see he may also have had some ulterior motives for a 
                different method of apportionment. He suggested the following approach:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Compute the divisor and then the initial quota as in the Hamilton Method.
                      If the initial quota provides the correct number of representatives, then
                      you are done.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If there are too few representatives, we will try a smaller divisor.
                      A smaller divisor has the potential to increase one or more of the
                      states<rsq/> quotas. (Once again you keep only the whole number portion.)
                      If the sum of the resulting quotas is equal to the required number
                      of representatives, then the process is concluded.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If there are too many representatives, we will try a larger divisor. 
                      A larger divisor has the potential to decrease one or more of the 
                      states<rsq/> quotas. If the sum of the resulting quotas is equal to the
                      required number of representatives then the process is concluded.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The process may need to iterate a few times to conclude. Keeping a list
                      of attempted divisors and whether they resulted in too many or too few 
                      representatives will help to avoid extra work. (Why?)
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                You will notice that the Jefferson Method, unlike the Hamilton Method, has
                a more open-ended process. You might have heard the sort of process required
                in the latter phase as <q>guess-and-check</q>. We have tried to include 
                enough rationale and intuitive description so that we might at least hope
                it to be, for you, <q>educated-guess-and-check</q>. If you look at your list
                of attempted divisors, what you should see is a sequence of numbers that is
                progressively working its way in towards the final divisor that worked, often
                from both above and below. Note also that this <q>final divisor</q> isn't 
                unique. If you and a friend work through the process and check your answer
                at the end, you should both find the same final quota for each state, but 
                your final divisor might be different (though probably not all
                <em>that</em> different).

      <chapter xml:id="ch-weighted-voting">
        <title>Power in Weighted Voting Systems</title>
        <p>
          All of the effort put into the systems described in the previous chapter were premised upon an
          intuitive idea: that if a state has, for example, twice the representatives, then it will have
          twice the power in the House of Representatives. But remember: one of the overarching themes of
          this book is that we want to be able to use mathematics and its related fields to investigate 
          whether our intuitive ideas about how things work are, in fact, accurate. We have already seen
          some examples of how this can happen. But the belief related to this idea of power is quite
          surprising and can be motivated with a relatively simple example.
        </p>
        <example>
          <title>Intuition Misleading Us?</title>
          <p>
            Suppose there were three states in the nation with populations such that, in the 100-member House
            of Representatives, one state had 49 representatives, one state had 47 representatives, and a third
            state had four representatives. 
            Let us further assume that these numbers of representatives are
            proportional to population. 
            (For example, this would be exactly true if the populations were 49,000, 
            47,000, and 4000, respectively.) 
            So according to the intuition we have
            been basing our work on up until now, this system has been constructed 
            in a way that is fair. It has explicitly and exactly matched the proportion of 
            numbers of representatives to the proportion of the number of people in the
            population for each state. (If you look back at examples and exercises from 
            <xref ref="ch-democracy-representation"/> you will notice that in practice
            it will almost never happen that these proportions match so exactly. We have, 
            in a sense, imagined what seems to be a rather ideal situation for fairness
            in the proportional representation of these states in this legislative body.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we proceed further, if you were to guess how powerful each state was
            in the legislature, what would you say? Is the state with 49,000 people twice
            as powerful as the state with 4000 people? Five times as powerful? (Note: you
            should not feel bad if you have only a vague sense of this. <q>Power</q> is
            a concept that we have not carefully defined. Indeed, that is the point of this
            section, to develop a coherent approach to thinking mathematically about

            So let us suppose that these states have quite distinct populations and, further,
            let us suppose that each state delegation is disciplined and loyal and always
            votes together as a group.

            500 from State 3 to State 1. Now what?

          Now that we are becoming more comfortable with percentages and proportions, why not think about a
          proportion of the time that something happens? It isn't that different, conceptually, to say that 65%
          of some group of 100 people have brown eyes as it is to say that 65% of the 100 days from February 14
          to May 25 have some rain that falls on Seattle at some point during that day.

        <title>Marx and his Mathematical Models</title>
        <p>
          The brilliant philosophical and economic thinker, Karl Marx, is one of the most influential 
          minds over the last two centuries, especially in our understanding of the current dominant world
          economic system, capitalism. While it is beyond the scope of this textbook to debate whether Marx
          was right or not (in itself a strange debate, generally driven by ideology rather than honest desire
          for truth) instead we will focus on Marx's clever deployment of mathematical models to help drive
          insight for himself and understanding for others. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Marx was faced with a problem: he saw the dynamic creative potential within capitalism, yet he also clearly saw
          (in a way that far too many self-interested capital boosters now do not) the enormous violence 
          this economic system visited upon those who performed the vast majority of the hazardous and back-breaking
          labor within it. In the face of many theorists before and since, Marx sought a mode of analysis that would
          not only explain the movement of capital and the deployment of labor power, but also might generate
          insights about instability within the system and long-term tendencies. All of this, he is carrying out very 
          near the birth of capitalism and in the context of its early working out of its principles and practices.

        <title>Statistics: Summarizing and Hypothesizing</title>
        
        <section> 
          <title>A Dizzyingly Complex World</title>
          <p>
            A beautiful reality is that we inhabit a universe that is boundlessly complex,
            filled with processes and orders that we have only barely begun to understand. 
            One cannot get very far into the scientific world without hearing a lot about
            statistics, and so we will begin to explore them here.   
          </p>
          <p>
            The key idea for statistics is this: given that our ways of measuring reality
            are many, and given that many groups of objects or phenomena that we might 
            wish to measure and understand are quite numerous, how can we grasp patterns
            or tendencies within these groups? As humans, we have a very limited ability
            to recognize patterns or tendencies from within a huge list of numbers. We 
            simply did not evolve to have intuition for that sort of thing. The field we 
            call <q>statistics</q> is designed precisely to give us methods of summarizing
            and understanding tendencies within groups of objects.
            
            <example>
              <p> 
                Suppose we wished to understand a certain variety of penguin inhabiting
                southerly islands at some point in time. We might wish to undestand the size
                of the adult penguins. Now, size might be measured in a variety of ways: length,
                mass, circumference of head, circumference of torso.

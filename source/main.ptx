        <title>Introduction: What is this for?</title>
        <p>
          The goal for this textbook is that it be different.
          Though many familiar topics will be explored, the person thinking along with this book
          will, with luck and commitment, work their way towards a different view of the world
          as it now exists. Ideally, the person thinking along with this book will find themselves
          committed to radical restructuring of the existing world order, which, in the opinion of this
          book<rsq/>s author, is monstrously wasteful of human potential, ecocidal towards human and
          nonhuman life, disruptive of unique and fascinating natural processes, stiflingly unfree and 
          cramped in its practices and beliefs.        
          Mathematics and its associated fields (statistics, data science, computer science,
          and so on) are often used to describe or predict the world. This is no longer enough. 
          The point is to change the world. The hope, and the wager, is that an approach to 
          some basic and fundamental mathematical ideas can equip and energize the reader, that is, you, 
          for that beautiful, important, and ennobling task.

              Quantitative reasoning, often called mathematics, is a

          The French thinker Jacques Ranciere wrote a fascinating book,
          <pubtitle>The Ignorant Schoolmaster</pubtitle> about the
          French educator Joseph Jacotot. To radically oversimplify the point:
          Jacotot believed that all humans are equally intelligent and that
          explanation and lecture could often serve the purpose of 
          <q>stultifying</q>. That is, there is real cost in striving to skip
          past the struggle to understand by way of an explanation from a
          so-called authority in the subject. A powerful and challenging thought!
          Though this author will not now cease writing, and thus will be in 
          some violation of Jacotot<rsq/>s ideas (or at least Ranciere<rsq/>s

        <title>Percentages and Proportionality</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            We will open with a consideration of fractions, proportions, and percentages.
            These ideas are deeply interrelated and, what is more, incredibly tied
            to a lot of intuitive ideas about fairness.
          </p>
        </introduction>
        <section xml:id="sec-proportion">
          <title>Proportion</title>
          
            <p>
              We begin with a very simple sort of idea, one that you have probably seen before. 
              It is the idea of proportion or fraction. In what we might optimistically
              interpret as a hopeful sign, this concept is often introduced using the idea 
              of fair division of resources. If there are four bottles of water and four
              thirsty people, then we might easily decide that each thirsty person should
              get one bottle of water. That is, we divide the four bottles four ways, which 
              allows one bottle in each group. We indicate this by 
              <me>
                4 \div 4 = 1  
              </me>
              or
              <me>
                \dfrac{4}{4} = 1
              </me>.
              If we have eight bottles of water and four thirsty people, then:
              <me>
                \dfrac{8}{4}=2
              </me>
              and we conclude that we can give each person two bottles of water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this rests on an assumption that each person has equal need 
              for water. This assumption is extremely time- and situation-dependent.
              If one of the people has just been rescued from the desert or one of 
              the people is a child, we may need to adjust our use of mathematics.
              This may seem very obvious, yet many of our analyses of real-life 
              situations will show how often this assumption is ignored or abused, 
              usually when it favors the rich and/or powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
              This idea is easily extended beyond whole numbers into fractions, 
              though it is possible you have not thought about this aspect of fractions
              for some time. (Much of this text will be seeking to render visible 
              the assumptions and initial intuitive notions that may have been 
              introduced to you so long ago that you have forgotten why they are 
              intuitive.) But if we have six cookies and 12 children (all of whom 
              can safely eat all the ingredients in the cookies) we can, once more,
              use division to determine how many cookies each child may have. It 
              should be evident that there aren't enough cookies even for each 
              child to have a whole one to themselves.
              <me>
                \dfrac{6}{12}=0.5
              </me>
              This tells us that each child can have 0.5 of a cookie, which we tend to 
              call half a cookie, or <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m> a cookie. You probably 
              understand the concept of <q>half</q>.
              But what if two of the children suddenly announce that they do not like
              this sort of cookie and would prefer not to have any. Now we have ten children
              and six cookies, which yields the situation:
              <me>
                \dfrac{6}{10}=0.6
              </me>
              This tells us that each child gets 0.6 of a cookie. What does this mean?
              We know it is less than a cookie and more than half a cookie. But how
              do we say anything more carefully and more explicit than this?
            </p>
            <p>
              If you found yourself saying, <q>That means 60% of a cookie,</q> then 
              congratulations. You just introduced us to the topic of the next section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we move on, we can recognize here the first instance of
              an important pattern. Many mathematical learners find themselves 
              impatient with memorization and formulas. This is quite understandable,
              especially when these have been used in place of building intuition 
              about why something works, why something does what we claim that it 
              does. This reflects our commitment to <xref ref="axiom-intuitive-math"/>. 
              In this case, the pattern to notice is that the number in the numerator
              (the top of the fraction) represents the number of objects we are 
              intending to share, while the denominator is the number of people we are 
              intending to share the objects amongst.
              <men>
                \dfrac{\text{# of objects to distribute}}
                {\text{# of objects that will receive what we distribute}}
              </men>
              We will, many times, find ourselves creating a template like this forming
              a simple fraction which will, nevertheless, provide us with powerful tools
              for supplementing our human intuition.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, we have a technical name for the description of a 
              process that allows us to compute
              or understand some situation: <term>algorithm</term>. This name is one of
              many that derive from Arabic or Islamic sources, a creative and
              vibrant piece of mathematical
              history that was ignored or de-emphasized by
              so-called <q>Western</q> historians and mathematicians
              for far too long. You can find out
              more in Berggren's <pubtitle>Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam</pubtitle>. 
              The word <q>algorithm</q> itself comes from the
              name of the Islamic mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, about whom you can read
              <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Khwarizmi/">here</url>,

          <title>Percent</title>
          <introduction>
            <p>
              Once we have the idea of a fraction, there is a benefit to introducing
              a sort of general format for a fraction. This is what a percent is. 
              It is even right there in the name, <em>percent</em>, from Latin. 
              The English language is filled with all sorts of fragments from other
              languages. Think of how you have heard <q>per</q> used. 60 miles per hour.
              45,000 dollars per year. 2000 calories per day. One dollar per taco.
              In each case, we are being
              informed of a certain amount of things for each of another object.
              So what does <q>cent</q> stand for then? If you think of the word 
              century, which is 100 years, maybe you will realize it stands for 100.
              So if we say <q>60 percent</q> we are really saying, <q>60 for each
              100</q>. So if we say, <q>60 percent of those children over there
              would like to eat
              some candy,</q> what we are actually expressing is that <q>if there 
              were 100 children like those children over there, then 60 of them
              would like to eat some candy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you see how this is a sort of standardized form of a fraction?
              We could say <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> or a quarter, but if we want a percent?
              We would say <q>25 percent.</q> Note also that we have a familiar
              notation for percent, which looks like this: %. So we could also just
              write: 25%. 
            </p>
          </introduction>

            <subsection xml:id="subsec-general-fact">
              <title>A Useful General Fact about Percents and Proportions</title>
              <p>
                None of this would probably be worth learning, if not for what follows.
                Let us think about the situation with 12 children and six cookies.
                What if one of those children goes home and realizes that they would
                like to share their portion of a cookie, which we can recall was
                half a cookie, with their two other siblings. But then how much cookie
                does each sibling receive, if we assume that all three of them get
                the same amount? We are now dividing half the cookie into three equal
                pieces. If we think from the start of the process we can see:
                <me>
                  \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)}{3}=\dfrac{1}{6} \approx 0.167.
                </me>
                Note that this means we could say that each child gets approximately
                16.7% of a cookie. Or one-sixth of a cookie. Perhaps you recall that the 
                process above can also be accomplished by multiplication:
                <me>
                  \left(\dfrac{6}{12}\right)\times\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)
                  =\dfrac{6}{36}=\dfrac{1}{6}\approx 0.167=16.7\%
                </me>
                We can think of this as first dividing the six cookies into 12 pieces,
                then dividing one of those smaller pieces into three equal pieces.
                This process is carried out by successive applications of taking some
                percentage.
              </p>
              <p>
                But let us emphasize this point: We may learn what percent of a cookie
                we are left with if we start with 50% of a cookie and then take 33% of it
                by multiplying the two decimal forms of these percents:
                <me>
                  (0.50)\times(0.3\overline{3})=0.16\overline{6}
                </me>
                Note that we should always be careful when moving from fractions to 
                decimal approximations of numbers or percentages. (This is a nice
                example of how moving between modes of implementation can sometimes
                mislead us.)

              those states should (sometimes) have that representation
              scaled by the population of that state. From the start, this 
              was a contested idea for many reasons, both because there 
              was no agreement on who counted as part of population and 
              related questions of how to handle the enslaved population. 
              If enslaved persons were counted as part of the population
              even though they had no practical voice in decision-making, then
              those who enslaved them would be granted extra power within
              the decision-making bodies of the young nation. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea of a representative legislative body itself offers a 
              good lens on the idea of democracy itself. If we have a state with
              100,000 people, we could make decisions by allowing each person to
              vote directly on every decision. You can see that this might be
              rather unwieldy in practice, but there would be, in a sense,
              no distortion at all. Every person is directly represented in
              the decision-making process; each person represents themself. 
              At the other extreme, we could select (by vote or by lottery) 
              one person to make the decisions for all 100,000 people. This
              allows the one person to swiftly make decisions, but we might 
              be disturbed that this person is now a dictator, at least until
              a new person is selected. So all representative bodies in between 
              are aimed at greater efficiency than everyone voting directly and
              more nuance and less total control than the one-person-in-charge
              version. But how do we do this in a fair and reasonable way?

              Suppose you have four states<mdash/>Mardi, Omoo, Pierre, 
              Redburn<mdash/>who wish to form a representative 
              legislative body with the number of representatives proportional
              to the states' populations. The populations are 30,000 in Mardi,
              40,000 in Omoo, 
              50,000 in Pierre, 
              and 70,000 in Redburn. The legislative body is to have 101
              representatives. (Perhaps the odd number was chosen 
              to avoid ties.) How would
              you suggest that this country go about doing this?
            </p>
            <p>
              A reasonable way to start is to consider proportions. Keep in mind
              the ways we have attempted to think about fairness previously. 
              What would it mean to match proportions in this case? We 
              need to recognize what proportion of population each state has.
              For that we also need total population and then we can use the 
              pattern or template we noted above.

              Let us put it another way: we want to distribute 101 cookies to 190,000
              people. In this view, we are trying to understand how much of a
              representative does each person get representing them in the

                  If we find this number, what would be the
                  next logical step for finding how many representatives each
                  state should have in the legislature?

                  If we have determined how much of a <q>cookie</q> each person
                  gets, then we can just see how many people are in a state and
                  add up all the (parts of) cookies that should be in that state.
                  That is, if we have determined how much of a <q>representative</q> 
                  each person is represented by,

            <title>The Hamilton and Jefferson Methods of Apportionment</title>
            <introduction>
              <p>  
                Two early methods are labeled by names that will be familiar to you
                if you have brought into yourself historical knowledge of the forming
                of the United States of America. Let us begin with the <em>Hamilton Method</em>.
              </p>
            </introduction>
            <subsection xml:id="subsec-hamilton">
              <title>The Hamilton Method</title>
              <p>
                The challenge for the so-called <q>Founding Fathers</q> was that in 
                most situations where the population of states was different from each 
                other, and with most numbers of representatives in the legislative body,
                there would be the need to determine how to round off answers. Hamilton
                suggested the following approach:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Find the number of people each representative should represent,
                      if only the division could be accomplished perfectly.
                      We call this the <term>divisor</term>. How should it be computed? 
                      Take the full population and divide it by the number of representatives
                      in the legislature. So, 
                      <m>
                        d=\frac{\text{total population}}{\text{number of legislators}}
                      </m>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Now take each state<rsq/>s population and divide it by the divisor,
                      keeping only the whole number part which we call the
                      <term>initial quota</term>. Note that each state must 
                      be given at least one representative, even if the number computed 
                      above is smaller than 1.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If the sum of these initial quotas is equal to the size of the
                      legislature, then we have determined the proper representation for
                      each state. If it is fewer representatives than the total (this is
                      the most common occurrence) then you look at the decimal portion
                      from each initial quota and award another representative 
                      to the state with largest decimal part. Continue awarding 
                      additional representatives to the next largest decimal part
                      until the total number of representatives is equal to the
                      size of the legislature. This is the <term>final quota</term>
                      for each state.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <example>
                <p>
                  It is often important to think about what limitations there might
                  be on how an algorithm might function. In this case, the insistence
                  (which seems relatively innocent) that every state receive at least one
                  representative could potentially cause a breakdown. Consider a seven-state 
                  country with one state with 30,000 people and the other six states all
                  the same size of 500 people. If we had a 30-representative legislature, 
                  then the algorithm above would give 27 representatives to the large state
                  and one representative each to the other six states, for a total of 33
                  representatives. But this is too many for the legislature! This
                  requires a sort of addendum to the process, of the sort we generally like
                  to avoid in algorithms like this. We could just say, well, the large state
                  only gets 24 and that fixes the problem, but might this also happen with
                  two large states and 12 small states? Then where do the spare representatives
                  come from? And if the two large states aren't quite the same size? You can 
                  see how quickly things become complicated. Consideration of these <q>edge</q> or
                  <q>extreme</q> cases is important in any exploration of the mathematical
                  behavior of such systems.

            <subsection xml:id="subsec-jefferson">
              <title>The Jefferson Method</title>
              <p>
                The enslaver Thomas Jefferson, who systematically sexually assaulted 
                some of the people he enslaved, objected to the Hamilton Method. This was
                perhaps partially based on the fact that
                the apportionment that it produced violated a specific numerical insistence
                in the Constitution, that no representative should represent more than 30,000
                people. We shall see he may also have had some ulterior motives for a 
                different method of apportionment. He suggested the following approach:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Compute the divisor and then the initial quota as in the Hamilton Method.
                      If the initial quota provides the correct number of representatives, then
                      you are done.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If there are too few representatives, we will try a smaller divisor.
                      A smaller divisor has the potential to increase one or more of the
                      states<rsq/> quotas. (Once again you keep only the whole number portion.)
                      If the sum of the resulting quotas is equal to the required number
                      of representatives, then the process is concluded.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If there are too many representatives, we will try a larger divisor. 
                      A larger divisor has the potential to decrease one or more of the 
                      states<rsq/> quotas. If the sum of the resulting quotas is equal to the
                      required number of representatives then the process is concluded.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The process may need to iterate a few times to conclude. Keeping a list
                      of attempted divisors and whether they resulted in too many or too few 
                      representatives will help to avoid extra work. (Why?)
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                You will notice that the Jefferson Method, unlike the Hamilton Method, has
                a more open-ended process. You might have heard the sort of process required
                in the latter phase as <q>guess-and-check</q>. We have tried to include 
                enough rationale and intuitive description so that we might at least hope
                it to be, for you, <q>educated-guess-and-check</q>. If you look at your list
                of attempted divisors, what you should see is a sequence of numbers that is
                progressively working its way in towards the final divisor that worked, often
                from both above and below. Note also that this <q>final divisor</q> isn't 
                unique. If you and a friend work through the process and check your answer
                at the end, you should both find the same final quota for each state, but 
                your final divisor might be different (though probably not all
                <em>that</em> different).

            <introduction>
              <p>
                We will explore two more methods of apportionment. But why? Are not
                two methods already one more than we need? This is another occasion
                where we can learn from unexpected behaviors of complex systems.
                What if we designed a system, using our intuition, to accomplish
                a task, but then we find that in practice, despite our care in 
                designing the system, we find unexpected possible outcomes, possibly
                even outcomes that offend our intuition about how the system behaves?
                This sort of behavior is sometimes called a <term>paradox</term>. 
                Though the use of this term in cases like this is slightly at odds with 
                its technical and historical meaning in logic and philosophy, we will 
                retain it to mean, for us, 
                <q>
                  behaviors that our system exhibit but which offend our sense of
                  how the system ought, based on our intended design, to behave

                We may proceed through the remaining methods of apportionment
                more quickly. The fundamental concepts in place above are 
                only slightly altered in the following approaches. With both
                Hamilton and Jefferson methods, the driving idea was finding 
                the divisor, then finding a way to apportion the remaining
                representatives after whole numbers have been given. For the
                remaining two methods, the Webster Method and the Huntington-Hill
                Method, the second of which is still (as of 2025) being used 
                by the USA, the approach involves adjustment of the divisor,
                similar to the Jefferson Method, combined with a system of 
                rounding to whole numbers. In both Hamilton and Jefferson 
                methods, recall that we round down (or <term>truncate</term>)
                the result of dividing the population by the divisor. For
                the Webster Method, we simply round to the nearest whole 
                number in the usual way: by rounding down if the fractional
                portion is less than 0.5 and rounding up if the fractional
                portion is larger than 0.5. (In the unlikely event that the
                fractional portion is exactly 0.5, the usual rule is to round
                up.) For Huntington-Hill Method, the boundary for rounding
                up is made more generous. We will explore this in detail
                in examples.

        <title>Power in Weighted Voting Systems</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            All of the effort put into the systems described in the previous chapter were premised upon an
            intuitive idea: that if a state has, for example, twice the representatives, then it will have
            twice the power in the House of Representatives. But remember: one of the overarching themes of
            this book is that we want to be able to use mathematics and its related fields to investigate 
            whether our intuitive ideas about how things work are, in fact, accurate. We have already seen
            some examples of how this can happen. But the belief related to this idea of power is quite
            surprising and can be motivated with a relatively simple example.
          </p>
          <example xml:id="ex-weighted-intuition">
            <title>Intuition Misleading Us?</title>
            <p>
              Suppose there were three states in the nation with populations such that, 
              in the 100-member House
              of Representatives, one state, Alsaka, had 49 representatives, 
              one state, Bartleby, had 47 representatives, and a third
              state, Cropland, had four representatives. 
              Let us further assume that these numbers of representatives are
              proportional to population. 
              (For example, this would be exactly true if the populations were 49,000, 
              47,000, and 4000, respectively.) 
              So according to the intuition we have
              been basing our work on up until now, this system has been constructed 
              in a way that is fair. It has explicitly and exactly matched the proportion of 
              numbers of representatives to the proportion of the number of people in the
              population for each state. The state that has 49% of the population has
              49% of the representatives, the state that has 47% of the population has 47% of
              the representatives, and the state that has 4% of the population has 4% of 
              the representatives.
              (If you look back at examples and exercises from 
              <xref ref="ch-democracy-representation"/> you will notice that in practice
              it will almost never happen that these proportions match so exactly. We have, 
              in a sense, imagined what seems to be a rather ideal situation for fairness
              in the proportional representation of these states in this legislative body.)
              Our intuition has told us and our justification for all
              the work in <xref ref="ch-democracy-representation"/> is based on the idea that
              this should preserve those proportions, as well, in terms of decision-making
              power. That is, if you have 49% of the representatives, you should have
              roughly 49% of the decision-making power, similarly 47% of the representatives
              should give you 47% of the decision-making power, and 4% of the representatives
              should give you 4% of the decision-making power.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we proceed further, if you were to guess how powerful each state was
              in the legislature, what would you say? Does it match the percentages
              described above? Or is the state with 49,000 people twice
              as powerful as the state with 4000 people? Five times as powerful? (Note: you
              should not feel bad if you have only a vague sense of this. <q>Power</q> is
              a concept that we have not carefully defined. Indeed, that is the point of this
              section, to develop a coherent approach to thinking mathematically about 
              how power might be quantified in such situations.)
            </p>
            <p>
              So let us suppose that these states have quite distinct populations and, further,
              let us suppose that each state delegation is disciplined and loyal and always
              votes together as a group. (If you think this changes your idea of the power of
              each state, that seems reasonable to me. Interesting how quickly assumptions
              and constraints change our ideas about how a system works, no?)
            </p>
            <p>
              How do things play out? Well let us think it through: Suppose the proposed
              measure that this legislative body is deliberating upon is whether to 
              locate a (necessary?) toxic
              waste dump in Cropland. We might expect this to be approved by the 49
              representatives from Alsaka and the 47 from Bartleby, which would allow
              the measure to pass by majority vote. (Note that there is another assumption
              here, one we might do well to (re)consider later, namely that simple majority,
              which in this case would be 51 out of 100, is all that is needed to
              pass a measure.) Obviously 96 votes will suffice to pass the measure.
              That is to say: if both Alsaka and Bartleby favor a measure, then that 
              measure will be approved by the legislative body. 
            </p>
            <p>
              But suppose, instead, that a measure were introduced to place the 
              waste dump in Alsaka? Why, then we might expect that Bartleby and
              Cropland could agree to vote in favor of this measure, which would
              thus pass by a 51 to 49 count. A measure passed by 51 to 49 is just as
              binding as a measure passed by 96 to 4. This fact turns out to have
              a rather interesting consequence. In fact, we can now notice the 
              following key fact: 
              <em>
                If two of the three states are in favor of a measure, then
                the measure will pass.
              </em>
              This may be quite surprising, even disturbing. Especially since
              it shows that our intuition about the scaling of representatives
              to population might completely fail to scale the decision-making
              power in the way we had hoped. Alsaka has the same amount of 
              power in this system as Cropland does, despite the fact that its
              population is over 12 times bigger. A citizen of Alsaka has 
              less than 
              <m>
                \frac{1}{12}
              </m>
              the amount of power as a citizen of Cropland. It is not unreasonable
              to think that over time this sort of distortion away from 
              <q>equal representation</q> might have rather significant effects
              upon the views citizens might have of the legitimacy of the 
              political system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that we have different ways we might think of the power
              in this system and how it is distributed. Based on previous
              ways we have been thinking about such things, we might
              choose to think of there being 100% of power that must be 
              distributed. Then in this case we would say that each 
              state has roughly 33% of the power. We could similarly 
              declare that all the power adds to 1 and say that each
              state has power measured at 0.33. 
              <aside>
                There is nothing preventing us from declaring there to be
                any amount of power which must be distributed. We might 
                set up our analysis such that 45 <q>power units</q> are 
                available to be distributed in the system. Then our analysis
                would conclude in this case that each state has 15 power
                units. But can you see how this is really just introducing a
                rather arbitrary additional number into the process? Is this
                not rather slightly illuminating to say that Cropland has 15
                of the 45 power units? It is easier just to say it has 33.3%
                of the power or 0.333 of the power.
              </aside>
            </p>
          </example>
          <p>
            Before we move on to a more systematic approach to computing power
            within a system like this, let us first notice how sensitive such 
            a system might be to changes in the conditions of the population.
          </p>
          <example>
            <p>
              Suppose a decade passes, and during that time
              1500 people move from State Bartleby to Alsaka and 
              500 from Cropland to Alsaka (but all other births and deaths
              cancel out so the only changes are these relocations). Now what?
            </p>
          </example>
          <p>
            In a rather beautiful demonstration of the fact that math and
            quantitative reasoning are creative processes, there are two 
            main approaches to computing the power available to each state
            in a system like this. The numbers they produce are sometimes the
            same but often are not. Each conceives of what matters in a different
            way, which we will summarize as the power in saying no and the 
            power in saying yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            One final task before we begin: the terminology and assumptions
            we will use throughout the following analysis. To achieve a sort 
            of generality of application, we will abstract slightly from the 
            descriptions above. Rather than states we will think of 
            <term>players</term> in a <term>weighted voting system</term>. 
            Each player will have a <term>weight</term>, and the system
            itself will have a <term>quota</term>, which is the required
            total weight of players required to pass a measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make this clear, in <xref ref="ex-weighted-intuition"/>, 
            there are
            three players, Alsaka with weight 49, Bartleby with weight 47, 
            and Cropland with weight 4. The quota in that example is 51. We 
            always require that the quota exceed half the total weight of the 
            system. (Why must we insist on this? How would the system potentially
            break down if we failed to require this?) Our notation for such a
            system will be: 
            <me>
              [51:49,47,4]  
            </me>
            We will always write the weights in descending order after the colon.
            More generally if we have <m>n</m> players, <m>P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n</m>
            with weights (in descending order)  <m>w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n</m> and 
            quota <m>q</m>, we will denote this weighted voting system as:
            <me>
              [q:w_1,w_2,\dots,w_n]
            </me>
          </p>
        </introduction>
        <section xml:id="sec-no-power">
          <title>The Power of No</title>
          <p>
            Our purpose in this section is to explore how we might measure
            power in a weighted voting system by the ability to say 
            <q>No!</q> to a measure and for that <q>No!</q> to matter. An 
            easy first step is to say that if it were impossible that a 
            <q>No!</q> from some player could matter, then this player
            has no power in the system. We might also say that player has
            zero power. We call such a player a <term>dummy</term>.          
          </p>
          <p>
            At the other end of this spectrum, if there is some player
            with so much weight that if they say <q>No!</q> to a measure
            then that measure can never pass, we say this player has
            <term>veto power</term> in the system. You may think that
            such a player must have all the power in the system, but 
            this is actually not the case.
            <example xml:id="ex-veto">
              <p>
                Consider the weighted voting system <m>[4:3,2,1]</m>.
                Since Player 2 and Player 3 only add to a total weight of 3, 
                this means they cannot pass a measure without Player 1. 
                Thus, Player 1 has veto power. But notice that Player 1 cannot
                pass a measure on their own, because their weight is also
                3, which is less than the quota, <m>q=4</m>. Neither Player 2
                nor Player 3 have veto power. But it also seems they may not
                be a dummies. (We will develop our abilities further to explore
                this question.)
              </p>
            </example>
            It turns out that it is possible that more than one player 
            might have veto power within a system:
            <example xml:id="ex-veto-multiple">
              <p>
                Consider the weighted voting system <m>[6:4,3,1]</m>. If
                we think about what is required to pass a measure in this 
                system, we see that Player 1 is needed, but so is Player 2.
                Player 1 and Player 3, even if they agree, do not reach
                the total weight required by the quota <m>q=6</m>. Similarly,
                Player 2 and Player 3, even if they agree, do not reach
                the quota. Thus,
                both Player 1 and Player 2 have veto power in this system.
                If either Player 1 or Player 2 say no to a measure, it will
                not pass.
                (It may be the case, now, that Player 3 is indeed a dummy.
                But we need, still, to develop our tools to be able to 
                explore this.)
              </p>
            </example>
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to systematically explore the Power of No (often called 
            <q>the Banzhaf power index</q>) we need to introduce the idea
            of a <term>winning coalition</term>. A winning coalition is any
            set of players which can pass a measure; that is, a winning 
            coalition is any set of players whose total weight meets or exceeds
            the quota.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step in computing the Power of No in a weighted
            voting system is to write down all
            the winning coalitions for that system.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            You are enmeshed in a system that insists upon your compliance
            in order for you to continue to eat. Only willing subjects to
            this system are afforded the calories and nutrients that
            allow their physical and biological substrate to continue to 
            function. If this sounds coercive, you are correct. It is.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key implements of coercion and power in the 
            current world system is the monetary system and its associated
            practices of credit and debt. This financial system is 
            massively complex at this point, including huge portions that
            not only run on computers but are controlled by computers, 
            sometimes in ways few humans do <em>or even can</em> 
            understand. The basics of interest, debt, credit, and the time 
            value of money will be covered in this chapter, with the 
            intention that the careful learners emerge better able to 
            protect themselves from those with massive power within
            the system. That is, the very rich.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will begin by introducing the concept of 
            <term>interest</term>, which is nothing more complex
            than a periodic proportional increase in an amount
            of money. Yet in practice what it becomes is a
            fee charged by those with more than enough
            money to live to those with less than enough money
            to live... to live.

            We will discuss this further once we have established
            the mechanics of the system. But keep this in mind as well:
            as we explore the logic and movement in this system, 
            remember always that it is a human system, contingent,
            changeable. Humanity has arranged its behavior and care
            for each other radically differently for the vast majority
            of human history.

              Economics and finance are often taught and thought as

              thought of that way.

          <title>Interest and Time</title>
          <p>
            We will take the idea of money as given, though, again, 
            one must keep in mind that it is only a contingent set
            of human practices that allow it to so thoroughly organize
            our lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once money is posited as part of the system, as a sort of 
            universal unit of exchange that can provide access to
            goods and services, necessary and frivolous alike, the issue
            of time also presents itself. Specifically, how does (or 
            should?) time and money interact. One way is that you do 
            or will eventually trade away part of your life to your
            boss, a portion of each of your finite number of days, in 
            exchange for money. This money can, in theory, then be 
            used to provide food and shelter and medical care to you
            and those you love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this book, we have often found ourselves in 
            pursuit of equivalents. (Or <q>equivalence</q>.) Here we find
            another needed pursuit: suppose you need money right now and 
            someone else has that money. Further, that person does not 
            need the money they have for use right now. They could give
            the money to you for you to use for the needed food or housing
            or medical care. They might ask only for the same amount of money
            in return at some future (specified or unspecified) date. 
            This rarely occurs. Generally, a larger amount of future money is
            expected in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a variety of reasons that might be given for this
            expectation. We might even view some of them as, more or 
            less, reasonable. What we must never do is lose sight of the
            fact that any such reason runs the risk of becoming so encrusted,
            even completely obscured by habit and privilege, that it
            becomes an item of faith upon which the lives and well-being of
            vulnerable people will be sacrificed without hesitation. 
          </p>
          <p>
            So let us present the reasons that the future repayment might
            be expected to be larger than the original loan amount, wary and
            with full awareness of the ways
            these reasons can be used to justify privation, want, 
            and exploitation of vulnerable persons.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Risk: the borrower may not pay the agreed future
                  amount, either because they will not or cannot. Thus, 
                  the creditor should be compensated for taking this risk
                  and the amount repaid should be larger than that loaned.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Lost access to the loaned money: the creditor no 
                  longer has the use of the loaned money in the interval
                  between loaning it and being repaid. Thus, the creditor 
                  should be compensated for this decrease in their 
                  financial autonomy 
                  and the amount repaid should be larger than that loaned.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Inflation: historically, on average, the value of 
                  money has a tendency to decrease. This means a dollar now
                  tends to be able to purchase more than a dollar in a
                  month or a year or a decade. (when I was a teen, it cost
                  $7 to see an evening movie. Nowadays, a teen would watch
                  it free via torrent on their phone. But if they went to the
                  theater to see an evening movie it would cost around $15.) 
                  Since a dollar now will (usually) buy less than a dollar in 
                  the future, the creditor should be compensated to mitigate 
                  this decay in purchasing power
                  and the amount repaid should be larger than that loaned.

                Mary needs $100 to buy food for her four children. 
                Richard has $100 he is not using and will not need for a 
                month. He agrees to loan Mary money to feed her 
                children as long as she will pay him back an extra 
                10% at the end of the month. Mary has little choice 
                but to agree.
              </p>
              <p>
                How much does Mary pay at the end of the month? We
                know from what we learned in 
                <xref ref="ch-percent-proportion"/>
                that 10% of $100 is: 
                <me>
                  (0.10)(100)=10
                </me>
                So Mary will repay the original $100 plus the 
                extra $10 for a total of $110. We call the
                $10 the <term>interest</term>. We call the 10% 
                the <term>interest rate</term> for the period of
                one month.

          Now that we are becoming more comfortable with percentages and proportions, why not think about a
          proportion of the time that something happens? It isn't that different, conceptually, to say that 65%
          of some group of 100 people have brown eyes as it is to say that 65% of the 100 days from February 14
          to May 25 have some rain that falls on Seattle at some point during that day.

        <title>Marx and his Mathematical Models</title>
        <p>
          The brilliant philosophical and economic thinker, Karl Marx, is one of the most influential 
          minds over the last two centuries, especially in our understanding of the current dominant world
          economic system, capitalism. While it is beyond the scope of this textbook to debate whether Marx
          was right or not (in itself a strange debate, generally driven by ideology rather than honest desire
          for truth) instead we will focus on Marx's clever deployment of mathematical models to help drive
          insight for himself and understanding for others. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Marx was faced with a problem: he saw the dynamic creative potential 
          within capitalism, yet he also clearly saw
          (in a way that far too many self-interested capital boosters now do not) 
          the enormous violence 
          this economic system visited upon those who performed the vast 
          majority of the hazardous and back-breaking
          labor within it. In the face of many theorists before and since, 
          Marx sought a mode of analysis that would
          not only explain the movement of capital and the deployment 
          of labor power, but also might generate
          insights about instability within the system and long-term tendencies. 
          All of this, he is carrying out very 
          near the birth of capitalism and in the context of its early 
          working out of its principles and practices.

        <title>Statistics: Summarizing and Hypothesizing</title>
        
        <section> 
          <title>A Dizzyingly Complex World</title>
          <p>
            A beautiful reality is that we inhabit a universe that is boundlessly complex,
            filled with processes and orders that we have only barely begun to understand. 
            One cannot get very far into the scientific world without hearing a lot about
            statistics, and so we will begin to explore them here.   
          </p>
          <p>
            The key idea for statistics is this: given that our ways of measuring reality
            are many, and given that many groups of objects or phenomena that we might 
            wish to measure and understand are quite numerous, how can we grasp patterns
            or tendencies within these groups? As humans, we have a very limited ability
            to recognize patterns or tendencies from within a huge list of numbers. We 
            simply did not evolve to have intuition for that sort of thing. The field we 
            call <q>statistics</q> is designed precisely to give us methods of summarizing
            and understanding tendencies within groups of objects.
            
            <example>
              <p> 
                Suppose we wished to understand a certain variety of penguin inhabiting
                southerly islands at some point in time. We might wish to undestand the size
                of the adult penguins. Now, size might be measured in a variety of ways: length,
                mass, circumference of head, circumference of torso.

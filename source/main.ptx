        <title>Introduction: What is this for?</title>
        <p>
          The goal for this textbook is that it be different.
          Though many familiar topics will be explored, the person thinking along with this book
          will, with luck and commitment, work their way towards a different view of the world
          as it now exists. Ideally, the person thinking along with this book will find themselves
          committed to radical restructuring of the existing world order, which, in the opinion of this
          book<rsq/>s author, is monstrously wasteful of human potential, ecocidal towards human and
          nonhuman life, disruptive of unique and fascinating natural processes, stiflingly unfree and
          cramped in its practices and beliefs.       
          Mathematics and its associated fields (statistics, data science, computer science,
          and so on) are often used to describe or predict the world. This is no longer enough.
          The point is to change the world. The hope, and the wager, is that an approach to
          some basic and fundamental mathematical ideas can equip and energize the reader, that is, you,
          for that beautiful, important, and ennobling task.
        </p>
        <axiom xml:id="axiom-recognition-with-math">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Quantitative reasoning, often called mathematics, is a
              millennia-spanning human project across radically different
              cultures aimed at describing, predicting, and changing the
              world.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </axiom>
 
        <p>
          The French thinker Jacques Ranciere wrote a fascinating book,
          <pubtitle>The Ignorant Schoolmaster</pubtitle> about the
          French educator Joseph Jacotot. To radically oversimplify the point:
          Jacotot believed that all humans are equally intelligent and that
          explanation and lecture could often serve the purpose of
          <q>stultifying</q>. That is, there is real cost in striving to skip
          past the struggle to understand by way of an explanation from a
          so-called authority in the subject. A powerful and challenging thought!
          Though this author will not now cease writing, and thus will be in
          some violation of Jacotot<rsq/>s ideas (or at least Ranciere<rsq/>s
          rendering of Jacotot<rsq/>s ideas). Still:
        <axiom xml:id="axiom-learning">
          <statement>
            <p>
              The learner must do the learning.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </axiom>
        <axiom xml:id="axiom-teacher">
          <statement>
            <p>
              The only teacher is the learner.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </axiom>       
        <axiom xml:id="axiom-teacher-other-learners">
          <statement>
            <p>
              The learner-who-is-also-the-teacher will often benefit by
              learning with other learners.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </axiom>       
        <axiom xml:id="axiom-intuition-supplement">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Mathematical thinking is a powerful supplement to human intuition.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </axiom>       
        <axiom xml:id="axiom-intuitive-math">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Wherever possible, mathematical ideas should be grounded in human
              intuition.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </axiom>
